### 2\. Canva

Canva is a must-have software for anybody who modifies both pictures and videos. It may be accessed from both a smartphone and a computer. Furthermore, the free edition has all of the functionality you'll ever require. Here's your step-by-step guide to add border to video for Instagram using Canva:

**Step 1:** Try downloading and _launching_ the **Canva app**, or use the web browser to access it. Then go to **Social media** and pick your preferred film aspect ratio. Here I will choose Instagram Post.

![create instagram story video on canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-instagram-story-canva.jpg)

**Step 2:** Then upload the video to **Canva** to modify it and apply a border. To do so, go to the left pane and choose **Upload media** from the **Uploads** menu. Now navigate to the video's location and post it.

**Step 3:** The clip will appear under the **Videos** section in the **Uploads** category. To view the clip in the editing window, click on it. You may move the video around by dragging it.

(**Note:** If you'd rather use vibrant colors than plain old white borders, the color tab (top) provides a large color pallet to select from, as shown below).
