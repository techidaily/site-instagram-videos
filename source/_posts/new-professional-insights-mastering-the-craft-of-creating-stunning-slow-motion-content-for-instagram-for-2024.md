## Part 1: How to Record Slow Motion Video in Instagram

Instagram is a platform that regularly provides its users with various special effects to enhance their stories and posts. Among the new set of effects introduced for Instagram Boomerang was the slow-motion effect. The effect would help reduce the Boomerang clips to half of their parent speed. You can record a slow motion Instagram story the same way too!

Follow the easy instructions here by using the new Boomerang settings to reduce speed to your footage with the SlowMo effect:

### Step 1: Open Instagram

Launch the **Instagram app's Story** camera, and scroll down from the top of the screen before **Boomerang mode** appears (an infinity logo).

![create slow motion video on instagram - boomerang](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-boomerang-option.jpg)

### Step 2: Start Video Recording

Begin filming the boomerang, then select the **Infinity Symbol** in the upper right corner after you're finished.

![edit instagram boomerang video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/trim-tweak-boomerang-instagram.jpg)

### Step 3: Initiate the SlowMo effect to Video

Next, from the drop-down menu, select the **SlowMo effect**, which is the second from the left side, to slow down the movie.

**_GIFs, Texts_**_, and **Artwork** may be added just like any other Instagram Story. After that, select the **"Your Story"** button at the bottom left of the page to publish your fresh slow motion clips in the manner you normally would._

![  instagram slow motion video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-slow-motion-options.jpg)

## Part 2: How to Record a Slow Motion Video on iPhone and Upload on Instagram

Like Instagram, you can also record SlowMo videos on your iPhone. And it's not too difficult either. If you used the iPhone's standard camera app to make a video in SLO-MO format, only you have to do now is upload the captured slow motion clip to Instagram like every other video.

Whenever you record a video at SlowMo speed, it captures normally, but when you watch it back, you'll see the slow-motion aspect. You may also modify your video so that the slow-motion movement begins and ends when you want it to.

Here is the informative step-by-step guide for you to learn and record Slo-Mo videos on iPhone and then upload them on Instagram:

### Step 1: Open the Camera App

First and foremost, you need to launch the camera on your iPhone. You will see a range of options inside the camera, such as video, photo, etc. Tap on the Slo-mo option.

**_Note_**_: For iPhone 12 and iPhone 11 models, you can also record video_ _in Slo-mo effect with your frontal camera)._

![  record instagram slow motion video on iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-slow-motion-options.jpg)

### Step 2: Start Recording

After tapping the Slo-mo option, you can either begin recording using the volume button or the record button itself inside the camera. And you can even tap on the Shutter option to capture a still photo during the recording process.

### Step 3: Edit the Video

Click the clip thumbnail, select **Edit,** to configure a section of the movie to display in slow motion while the remainder plays normally. To specify the portion, you wish to play again in slow motion, drag the vertical lines underneath the screen viewer.

You may modify the slow-motion frame rate and quality based on your device. Change the settings for slow-motion filming by going to **Settings > Camera > Record Slo-mo.**

![  edit instagram slow motion video on iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-slow-motion-video-iphone.jpg)

### Step 4: Upload Video to Instagram

After editing the video and finalizing the small details, all you have to do is **Upload** the slow-motion video Instagram by clicking on this + sign.

**Size and Length limitations for Instagram Video**

* The minimum length for **vertical, horizontal**, and **squared videos** respectively are: (**600 X 750), (600 X 315)**, and **(600 x 600)**
* The maximum file size should be no more than **4GB**
* Maximum frame rate is 30FPS
* The maximum Instagram video length should be **60 seconds** for all videos. There is no limit for minimum-length videos.

## Part 3: How to Make a Slow Motion Video for Instagram on Desktop?

If you're looking to make a slow motion Instagram video, we suggest doing that via your desktop. It's honestly your safest bet! While we understand using your smartphone to edit your videos and then uploading them to Instagram seems like a convenient choice, desktop offers a variety of features to top that. You can not only add music to your slow motion Instagram videos, but you can also add several animations via desktop. Not to mention the graphic text and stickers are there to enhance your SlowMo video engagement.

However, if you use the [Wondershare Filmora software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can achieve much more. Features like Transitions, Overlays, Text Presets, and the Audio Editing Ability are a mere glimpse of what you can do using the Filmora software for making and editing a SlowMo Instagram video on your desktop.

Here is your step-by-step guide to making a slow motion video with Filmora:

### Step 1: Launch Filmora and Import the Clips

Run the **Filmora Video Editor** on your desktop, and select the correct aspect ratio accordingly. Filmora provides aspect ratio presets such as 9:16, 1:1, 19:9, 4:3 even 21:9 cinema mode, and here I will take the 1:1 aspect ratio for example.

![  select instagram aspect ratio on Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-instagram-aspect-ratio.jpg)

And then drag and drop the video clip to the media library or the timeline panel directly to start the editing.

### Step 2: Create Slow Motion Video Instagram

Right click the video present on the timeline, and then click the **Speed and Duration** option from the context menu. In the custom speed window, you can reduce the video speed using the drop-down menu or the cursor. Select the **OK** option when done.

![  change video speed to create instagram slow motion video on Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-video-speed-instagram-slow-motion.jpg)

**Step 3: Export the Slow Motion Instagram Video**

Locate the **Export** option and click on that. This will show the preferred output settings. Now select the **Format** of your desired video to Save. When the editing process begins, it will take time, depending on the size of the video. After the process finishes, locate the **Save** path to get your slow-motion Instagram video and then [upload it to Instagram](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on the desktop computer directly.

![Filmora export](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-export-interface.jpg)

## Part 4: How to Do Slow Motion Videos in Instagram Reels

How many of you have thought about whether you could slow down or fasten your videos on Instagram? The Slow-motion feature allows users to create entertaining videos by transforming ordinary objects into something extraordinary and unique. Instagram lets you make reels with a variety of special effects. We will now show you how to use Instagram Reels to create Slow-motion videos.

Slow motion video recording has gotten incredibly simple on Instagram reels. Without the need for any other pricey software, the video may be slowed down easily and rapidly online. Now you can adjust the playing speed and experiment with it. Follow these simple steps to make your Reels video:

### Step 1: Launch Instagram and Select the Reel Option

Launch the Instagram app. Once the main page opens, select the **plus icon** showing on the bottom end of the page. Then to enter the **Reels video mode**, select the **Reels option** from the bottom panel beside the story and live options.

### Step 2: Choose a Speed Setting

After selecting the Reels option, tap on the **Speed** option to choose from one of the five **Speed** settings. The setting is set to 1x speed, which is the default speed setting. Now, if you want to record a slow-motion video, set the setting from 0.3x to 0.5x according to your preference.

![Create Instagram Reels Slow motion video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-video-speed-options.jpg)

### Step 3: Start Recording

Now that you've adjusted the speed, click on the **Record** button to begin recording your video. You can also add music by tapping on the **audio** option. If you want to watch the video you've recorded, tap on the arrow button and enjoy your video!

## FAQs about Instagram Slow Motion

1. **Can I record only parts of the video in slow motion in Instagram Reel?**

Yes, you can. Instagram now also features the ability to record only a portion of a video that you want to slow down. You don't have to record your Reels video all at once. You can also record it in shorter clips. Then you may combine all the short snippets to make a whole slow-motion video. This allows you to record a video at a quicker rate while recording all other videos at a standard rate. Only a piece of your movie will play at a sluggish speed, while the remainder will go nicely.

1. **Why can't I upload a slow motion video on Instagram?**

To upload a slow-mo video on Instagram, you must first alter the video to a slow version and then save the video in a local file on your phones, because usually, you can save all types of videos on phones, but most phones don't support a rendered version of a slow-mo video. After this, you should be able to upload the video directly to Instagram.

1. **Besides slow motion, can I record fast-forward videos on Instagram?**

Yes, you can. Instagram features a fast-forward option. Select the speed option to change the video's speed to fast speed. You can set the video at three different fast-forward speed settings: 1x, 2x, and 3x. Now it has become very simple to record a fast-forward video on Instagram.

## FAQs about Instagram Slow Motion

1. **Can I record only parts of the video in slow motion in Instagram Reel?**

Yes, you can. Instagram now also features the ability to record only a portion of a video that you want to slow down. You don't have to record your Reels video all at once. You can also record it in shorter clips. Then you may combine all the short snippets to make a whole slow-motion video. This allows you to record a video at a quicker rate while recording all other videos at a standard rate. Only a piece of your movie will play at a sluggish speed, while the remainder will go nicely.

1. **Why can't I upload a slow motion video on Instagram?**

To upload a slow-mo video on Instagram, you must first alter the video to a slow version and then save the video in a local file on your phones, because usually, you can save all types of videos on phones, but most phones don't support a rendered version of a slow-mo video. After this, you should be able to upload the video directly to Instagram.

1. **Besides slow motion, can I record fast-forward videos on Instagram?**

Yes, you can. Instagram features a fast-forward option. Select the speed option to change the video's speed to fast speed. You can set the video at three different fast-forward speed settings: 1x, 2x, and 3x. Now it has become very simple to record a fast-forward video on Instagram.

## Part 1: How to Record Slow Motion Video in Instagram

Instagram is a platform that regularly provides its users with various special effects to enhance their stories and posts. Among the new set of effects introduced for Instagram Boomerang was the slow-motion effect. The effect would help reduce the Boomerang clips to half of their parent speed. You can record a slow motion Instagram story the same way too!

Follow the easy instructions here by using the new Boomerang settings to reduce speed to your footage with the SlowMo effect:

### Step 1: Open Instagram

Launch the **Instagram app's Story** camera, and scroll down from the top of the screen before **Boomerang mode** appears (an infinity logo).

![create slow motion video on instagram - boomerang](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-boomerang-option.jpg)

### Step 2: Start Video Recording

Begin filming the boomerang, then select the **Infinity Symbol** in the upper right corner after you're finished.

![edit instagram boomerang video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/trim-tweak-boomerang-instagram.jpg)

### Step 3: Initiate the SlowMo effect to Video

Next, from the drop-down menu, select the **SlowMo effect**, which is the second from the left side, to slow down the movie.

**_GIFs, Texts_**_, and **Artwork** may be added just like any other Instagram Story. After that, select the **"Your Story"** button at the bottom left of the page to publish your fresh slow motion clips in the manner you normally would._

![  instagram slow motion video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-slow-motion-options.jpg)

## Part 2: How to Record a Slow Motion Video on iPhone and Upload on Instagram

Like Instagram, you can also record SlowMo videos on your iPhone. And it's not too difficult either. If you used the iPhone's standard camera app to make a video in SLO-MO format, only you have to do now is upload the captured slow motion clip to Instagram like every other video.

Whenever you record a video at SlowMo speed, it captures normally, but when you watch it back, you'll see the slow-motion aspect. You may also modify your video so that the slow-motion movement begins and ends when you want it to.

Here is the informative step-by-step guide for you to learn and record Slo-Mo videos on iPhone and then upload them on Instagram:

### Step 1: Open the Camera App

First and foremost, you need to launch the camera on your iPhone. You will see a range of options inside the camera, such as video, photo, etc. Tap on the Slo-mo option.

**_Note_**_: For iPhone 12 and iPhone 11 models, you can also record video_ _in Slo-mo effect with your frontal camera)._

![  record instagram slow motion video on iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-slow-motion-options.jpg)

### Step 2: Start Recording

After tapping the Slo-mo option, you can either begin recording using the volume button or the record button itself inside the camera. And you can even tap on the Shutter option to capture a still photo during the recording process.

### Step 3: Edit the Video

Click the clip thumbnail, select **Edit,** to configure a section of the movie to display in slow motion while the remainder plays normally. To specify the portion, you wish to play again in slow motion, drag the vertical lines underneath the screen viewer.

You may modify the slow-motion frame rate and quality based on your device. Change the settings for slow-motion filming by going to **Settings > Camera > Record Slo-mo.**

![  edit instagram slow motion video on iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-slow-motion-video-iphone.jpg)

### Step 4: Upload Video to Instagram

After editing the video and finalizing the small details, all you have to do is **Upload** the slow-motion video Instagram by clicking on this + sign.

**Size and Length limitations for Instagram Video**

* The minimum length for **vertical, horizontal**, and **squared videos** respectively are: (**600 X 750), (600 X 315)**, and **(600 x 600)**
* The maximum file size should be no more than **4GB**
* Maximum frame rate is 30FPS
* The maximum Instagram video length should be **60 seconds** for all videos. There is no limit for minimum-length videos.

## Part 3: How to Make a Slow Motion Video for Instagram on Desktop?

If you're looking to make a slow motion Instagram video, we suggest doing that via your desktop. It's honestly your safest bet! While we understand using your smartphone to edit your videos and then uploading them to Instagram seems like a convenient choice, desktop offers a variety of features to top that. You can not only add music to your slow motion Instagram videos, but you can also add several animations via desktop. Not to mention the graphic text and stickers are there to enhance your SlowMo video engagement.

However, if you use the [Wondershare Filmora software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can achieve much more. Features like Transitions, Overlays, Text Presets, and the Audio Editing Ability are a mere glimpse of what you can do using the Filmora software for making and editing a SlowMo Instagram video on your desktop.

Here is your step-by-step guide to making a slow motion video with Filmora:

### Step 1: Launch Filmora and Import the Clips

Run the **Filmora Video Editor** on your desktop, and select the correct aspect ratio accordingly. Filmora provides aspect ratio presets such as 9:16, 1:1, 19:9, 4:3 even 21:9 cinema mode, and here I will take the 1:1 aspect ratio for example.

![  select instagram aspect ratio on Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-instagram-aspect-ratio.jpg)

And then drag and drop the video clip to the media library or the timeline panel directly to start the editing.

### Step 2: Create Slow Motion Video Instagram

Right click the video present on the timeline, and then click the **Speed and Duration** option from the context menu. In the custom speed window, you can reduce the video speed using the drop-down menu or the cursor. Select the **OK** option when done.

![  change video speed to create instagram slow motion video on Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-video-speed-instagram-slow-motion.jpg)

**Step 3: Export the Slow Motion Instagram Video**

Locate the **Export** option and click on that. This will show the preferred output settings. Now select the **Format** of your desired video to Save. When the editing process begins, it will take time, depending on the size of the video. After the process finishes, locate the **Save** path to get your slow-motion Instagram video and then [upload it to Instagram](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on the desktop computer directly.
