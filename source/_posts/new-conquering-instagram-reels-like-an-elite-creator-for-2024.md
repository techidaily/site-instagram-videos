There are two ways to create Instagram reels. You have the option to use the built-in editor or create and edit the video externally and then upload it. Both of these methods are very simple. Let’s have a look.

6\. **Record the video** in one go or divide your 15 seconds into segments and record short clips.

7\. Tap the right arrow once to preview the video. If you are satisfied and content with the result, tap the arrow again to save it.

![preview reels video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-reels-video5.jpg)

If you have a public account, the video will be discoverable by a larger Instagram community. Considering the popularity, it will also stand a chance to land in the **Explore** section, where it can be viewed and shared by millions of other people.
