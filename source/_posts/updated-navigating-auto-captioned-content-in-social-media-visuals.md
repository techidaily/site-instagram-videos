Instagram keeps bringing something new to its platform and for all good reasons. The latest one that is garnering a lot of attention is captioning for Instagram stories and reels. This feature will let viewers watch a Story or Reel without having the need to turn on their volume. Instead, the caption will display whatever is being talked about in the short video.

This feature becomes beneficial for people who are hard of hearing. Not just this, the caption feature is also ideal for people who find an interesting Story or Reel but don’t want to disturb the people around them by turning on the volume. Instagram rolled out this feature for Stories first, and then it was launched for Reels. Now, let’s find out how to use the **Instagram auto caption** feature.

## Part 1: How to Add Captions to Your Instagram Stories Automatically?

Auto-generated captions on Instagram are easy to add. However, there’s one thing that you need to know. The caption feature is available **only for English-speaking countries** and not everywhere else. Therefore, if you can see the caption feature on your Instagram, it means it is available for you, and if you can’t, try updating it once. And even after updating Instagram, if you still can’t find the caption option, it means it’s not available in your country. So, the steps that we have mentioned below is for those countries that have caption feature available in their Instagram app.

**Step 1:** First, log in to your Instagram account and click on your profile picture with the + sign. Click on the Story option and start recording something and keep talking.

![record instagram story](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-instagram-story-add-caption.png)

**Step 2:** Once done, you need to click on the emoticon option that you can see on the top of the screen.

You will see a list of stickers. From the list, you need to select Captions. There will be multiple formats available for the captions; choose one that you like.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Part 5: What Are Captions? And How Are They Different from Subtitles?

Although captions and subtitles may sound the same, both of them have different purposes to solve. You apply a caption to your videos that will allow hearing-impaired people to understand what you are saying in your video.

However, subtitles can be for any language. They are text for a language in a video that others may not understand. So, in a caption, you can see the video but can’t hear the audio. In the subtitle, you can see and hear both but can’t understand the language.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Part 6: Why You Should Add Captions on Instagram Stories and Reels?

Captions allow everyone to understand what you are saying in the video. Brands and companies, in particular, should create an all-inclusive ecosystem so that whoever watches the video understands right away the purpose of creating it. Since there are many people with hearing problems, not adding captions to stories and reels would mean discarding them.

The caption feature is one of the most anticipated features of Instagram and is praise-worthy for including everyone. Captions work both ways; it works as a subtitle for people who want to be sure that whatever you are saying in the Reel or Story is getting digested accurately, and it works as a text guide for people who are have hearing loss issues. Moreover, for people who don’t want to turn on the volume when they are in a quiet place, captions allow them to enjoy the video nevertheless.

Captions, in general, make the video story or reel watching experience better and convenient. However, if you are a brand, influencer, or company, and want to reach out to more people, add captions!

## Part 6: Why You Should Add Captions on Instagram Stories and Reels?

Captions allow everyone to understand what you are saying in the video.

Captions work both ways; it works as a subtitle for people who want to be sure that whatever you are saying in the Reel or Story is getting digested accurately, and it works as a text guide for people who are have hearing loss issues. Moreover, for people who don’t want to turn on the volume when they are in a quiet place, captions allow them to enjoy the video nevertheless.

Captions, in general, make the video story or reel watching experience better and convenient. However, if you are a brand, influencer, or company, and want to reach out to more people, add captions!

## Part 5: What Are Captions? And How Are They Different from Subtitles?

Although captions and subtitles may sound the same, both of them have different purposes to solve. You apply a caption to your videos that will allow hearing-impaired people to understand what you are saying in your video.

However, subtitles can be for any language. They are text for a language in a video that others may not understand. So, in a caption, you can see the video but can’t hear the audio. In the subtitle, you can see and hear both but can’t understand the language.

## Part 6: Why You Should Add Captions on Instagram Stories and Reels?

Captions allow everyone to understand what you are saying in the video. Brands and companies, in particular, should create an all-inclusive ecosystem so that whoever watches the video understands right away the purpose of creating it. Since there are many people with hearing problems, not adding captions to stories and reels would mean discarding them.

The caption feature is one of the most anticipated features of Instagram and is praise-worthy for including everyone. Captions work both ways; it works as a subtitle for people who want to be sure that whatever you are saying in the Reel or Story is getting digested accurately, and it works as a text guide for people who are have hearing loss issues. Moreover, for people who don’t want to turn on the volume when they are in a quiet place, captions allow them to enjoy the video nevertheless.

Captions, in general, make the video story or reel watching experience better and convenient. However, if you are a brand, influencer, or company, and want to reach out to more people, add captions!
