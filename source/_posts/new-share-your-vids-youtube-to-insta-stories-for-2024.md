You can access this feature at the Insta space instead of downloading it separately from the Google or Apple stores. Follow the below steps and learn how to share a YouTube link on Instagram story.

Step 1: Use the IGTV option on the Instagram space and create a video of the desired length along with CTA to add a title to the video. Then, upload it to the IGTV channel and include the link to the description.
