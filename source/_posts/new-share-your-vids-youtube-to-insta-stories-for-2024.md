It is a simple way to share the YouTube link on the Instagram story effortlessly. You can choose this method if you have 10K followers in your account.

#### For users without 10K follower

You can access this feature at the Insta space instead of downloading it separately from the Google or Apple stores. Follow the below steps and learn how to share a YouTube link on Instagram story.

Step 1: Use the IGTV option on the Instagram space and create a video of the desired length along with CTA to add a title to the video. Then, upload it to the IGTV channel and include the link to the description.
