Regular Posts: In the case of regular posts on the Instagram app, the expected aspect ratio is 1:1\. If you do not have square shape videos, then zoom out to landscape or portrait as per your requirements. Make the video sizes to either 1.91.1 (landscape) or 4:5 (Portrait). When you edit the aspect ratio, the resolution varies according to it respectively.
