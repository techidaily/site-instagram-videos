#### 5.Use the New Effects Added

There have been certain effects upgrades added to this app. With the new boomerang video effects, it is even more fun to create videos on Instagram. These are akin to filters and help add on something more to your Boomerang videos:

SlowMo: This is an effect or filter that helps to reduce speed to half. Hence, it helps videos to play slow in either direction.

Echo: This effect is like double vision. It helps content to stand out, similar to adding a motion blur to movements in your video.

Duo: This effect is like rewinding a video clip rapidly to the start. It also gives it a digitized look. It goes well with certain themes and can make your video look creative.

Instagram also allows users to trim the content in such videos. That allows users more flexibility on how they wish to present content. It helps you edit the lengths of Boomerang videos. You can decide which point a video would start and where it would end.
