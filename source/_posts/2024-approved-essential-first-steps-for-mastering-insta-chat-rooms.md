Since its inception, Instagram has grown in popularity as a method to engage with brands, celebrities, thought leaders, friends, family, and more. The launch of Instagram's IGTv function was a great success, and the platform isn't stopping there. Soon later, in the summer of 2019, Instagram added a new feature: you may now video chat with one or more of your friends in direct messaging without having to leave Instagram. This innovation will help Instagram to retain its users on the platform for longer than before, obviating the need for third-party programs such as Skype and Facetime.
