**Step 4**: To add borders to the video for Instagram, select the **Effect** tab present on the horizontal menu.

**Step 1**: Select the Start editing on Kapwing's website. It will lead you to the video file upload screen, where you may drag and drop the file or **Click to upload**.

**Step 2**: Here I will upload a 9:16 aspect ratio video to Kapwing as an example. Kapwing allows you to zoom out the video to make it smaller to make a border around the video. Besides, you can also drag the corners of the video to resize to get the borders.
