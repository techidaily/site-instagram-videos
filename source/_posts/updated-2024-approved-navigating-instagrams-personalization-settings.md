## Part 1: How to Block Your Followers on Instagram?

Please be informed that when you block someone on Instagram, that person will no longer see your profile, which means they won't be able to contact you or communicate with you. Another thing is that the person that you will block won't be notified about it. There are two ways to do that. One is through your Instagram app, and the second is through the web browser.

## Part 4: How to Unblock Someone on Instagram?

Just like blocking an account is possible, unblocking the same account is possible as well. Yet again, you can unblock someone using your Instagram app on your mobile phone; else, you can use any web browser and do the needful. Readers must note that when you unblock someone, the unlocked user won't know about it, but if they search you, they will be able to locate it. And if you don't keep your account private, they will be able to see all the posts and stories you share. To learn **how to unblock people on Instagram,** follow these simple steps.

### For Instagram app

**Step 1:** Launch Instagram on your Android device or iPhone, and log in to your account if you are not. Your profile will appear first. On your profile, you will see three dots or lines; that's the hamburger icon. Please click on that.

**Step 2:** Once you do, you will see multiple options. From the list, you need to click on the Settings option. You will see the privacy option; please tap on that.

**Step 3:** Under the Privacy tab, you will see some sub-tabs, and one of them will be blocked accounts. You need to hit the blocked accounts option.

**Step 4:** You will see all the accounts that you have blocked. Click on the account that you want to unblock, and click on the unblock option that you see towards the right.

## Part 5: Why Can't I Unblock a Person on Instagram?

If the two-way block has been implemented, then unblocking the same person will become problematic. Let's make it simpler. You have blocked someone recently, but you didn't know that the same person has also done the same thing. Now that you have been blocked when you try to unblock their account, you won't see it because that's how blocked accounts work. You will not see the person's account; their messages will be deleted, every like and comment shared on your profile will be removed too.

So, when the other person blocks a user, their account vanishes and doesn't appear in the blocked list. Even if you try to find their profile by entering their handle on the search bar, you will see the notification "user not found." And this is why you can't unblock that person. Both of you have blocked each other.

## Part 5: Why Can't I Unblock a Person on Instagram?

If the two-way block has been implemented, then unblocking the same person will become problematic. Let's make it simpler. You have blocked someone recently, but you didn't know that the same person has also done the same thing. Now that you have been blocked when you try to unblock their account, you won't see it because that's how blocked accounts work. You will not see the person's account; their messages will be deleted, every like and comment shared on your profile will be removed too.

So, when the other person blocks a user, their account vanishes and doesn't appear in the blocked list. Even if you try to find their profile by entering their handle on the search bar, you will see the notification "user not found." And this is why you can't unblock that person. Both of you have blocked each other.

## FAQs About Instagram Block

1. **How to see who blocked you on Instagram?**

Instagram doesn't offer you any direct way to know who has blocked you. However, if you have suddenly stopped seeing the posts and stories of a person you have been following, you can search for the person's account. If no account pops up, it could mean that this person has blocked you. Also, if you can navigate to their account, however, can't see anything, such as their profile picture, posts, and stories, that's a clear indication that you have been blocked. So, there's no direct way, and the only thing you can do is search for that person.

1. **What happens when you block someone on Instagram?**

Once you block a person on Instagram, they will no longer appear in your followers' list. They will no longer be able to track your account, see your profile picture, posts, and stories. Also, the person won't be notified that you have blocked them.

1. **Does blocking people on Instagram delete your messages?**

No, Instagram doesn't delete the messages from your inbox, but what it does is make the chat thread inactive. This means the messages won't show!

1. **When you block someone, do their likes disappear?**

Yes, both their likes and comments will disappear once you block someone.

1. **What does it look like when someone blocks you on Instagram?**

When someone blocks you, and you try to find that user, you will be shown this user is not available message instead of their profile. There won't be any profile photo, and it would appear as if the person is no longer using Instagram.

## Part 1: How to Block Your Followers on Instagram?

Please be informed that when you block someone on Instagram, that person will no longer see your profile, which means they won't be able to contact you or communicate with you. Another thing is that the person that you will block won't be notified about it. There are two ways to do that. One is through your Instagram app, and the second is through the web browser.

The best part about Instagram is that it not only allows you to block people who are creating a nuisance, but it also lets you check all the accounts that you have blocked.
