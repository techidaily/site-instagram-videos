The giant social network that is Instagram has never been more popular and is a hub of more than 40 billion photos and videos, with 95 million more being shared every day. Sometimes you might see an image or video you'd like to save for later or to use as wallpaper on your device.

If you're an Apple user, you'll already know it's not quite as simple as you might think to **save Instagram photos to iPhone and iPad devices**. Whether it's a copyright issue or simply that they want you on the app, Instagram doesn't let Apple devices download content from within the app itself, which can be frustrating if you see something you'd like to view again later.

If you've been wondering how to save Instagram photos on your iPhone, we've got just the tutorial for you. Here, we'll investigate a few different methods of getting those gorgeous images from the app and saving them to your camera roll, without tearing your hair out in the process.
