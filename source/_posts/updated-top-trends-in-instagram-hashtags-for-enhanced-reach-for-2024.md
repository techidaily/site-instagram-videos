## How To Select the Right HashTags for Your Podcast

If you're interested in building a successful podcast, you've got to get the correct hashtags. So today, we'll walk through the steps to finding the perfect hashtags for your podcast.

### Combination of broad and niche

All you need to do is niche down the leading podcast into the type of podcast you create. It must include the topic, industry, theme, background & idea for your podcast. Thus it will be unique to your brand. The more specific you get, the better.

### Combination of short & long

It would be best if you used short and long hashtags together to match the context of your podcast. For example, your podcast is on fitness. Your short hashtags will cover general topics like; health and healthy life. While longer hashtags would be more precise. For example: the right diet plan, workout routine plan, exercises, etc.

### Connect your target audience

Your target audience plays a vital role. Thus it's crucial to know how your target audience would search for your podcast. Knowing your audience better will make you choose the right hashtags. That will keep your audience growing.

### Keep updating

It is imperative to relate to the current trends of the podcast. This means you should keep updating your hashtags often with the changing trends. Avoid using tags that no longer match the podcast industry trends. Before uploading a new podcast that fits the trend, you need to know about the new hashtags.

## Final Words

In conclusion, the best hashtags to use on Instagram relate to your audience. For example, if your business focus is on yoga, try adding hashtags such as #yoga, #fitness, #wellness, etc.

Don't be afraid to take a leap of faith and use tags that you don't understand. You'll learn a lot by testing out new ideas. Experimenting with hashtags on Instagram is a great way to test new ideas and gain insights. It also identifies which ones might work best for your brand.
