At that very point, hold the record button and slide your finger up/down to zoom in/out the video. This is how to zoom in/out Instagram Stories using 'Hands-Free' mode.

Be it a 'Boomerang', 'Rewind', 'Hands-Free', or 'Normal' mode video, learning how to zoom in Instagram Stories is sure to make your stories cool and funky.
