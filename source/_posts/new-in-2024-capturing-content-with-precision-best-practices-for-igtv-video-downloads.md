Less than a year after the Instagram launched the IGTV it is becoming obvious that this platform is here to stay. The popularity of IGTV can be partially contributed to the fact that all of its users can now upload vertically oriented videos that last up to ten minutes or one hour if they own a verified account. **Downloading an IGTV video** from a computer is as simple as uploading it to the platform since you can save any IGTV video you want in just a few simple steps. So, in this article we are going to take you through five easiest solutions you can use to download IGTV videos to your Mac or PC computer.

Using the video content you download from IGTV as your own is strictly prohibited, and you may face legal consequences if you upload videos you didn’t create to your IGTV channel without permission. With that being said, here are the five best options for downloading IGTV videos from a computer.
