Instagram highlights are the rage these days, and there’s a reason for this. Instagram highlights provide a means for users to draw attention to and promote their brand. With these highlights, users can showcase and categorize their best content in a fancy and eye-catching way! Amazing right? Yes, it is and this is because Instagram highlights are front and center on your profile! This is a guide to Instagram highlights which explains what they are and how to use them.

## Part 1: What is Instagram Highlight?

Instagram highlights, also known as Instagram story highlights, were introduced on the 5th December of 2017\. An Instagram Highlight is displayed as a neat little circle on your profile. Unlike Instagram Stories that disappear after 24 hours, Instagram highlights stay on your profile permanently, until you choose to delete them. These highlights are tools designed by Instagram to enable its users to hold on to their favorite moments from their Instagram stories and share them in any way that allows them to express themselves.

Instagram highlights were included as a new feature of Instagram profiles through which users can express more about who they are through the various stories they have shared. They are designed to appear in the section on your profile which is located below your bio.

Story Highlights allows you to display all sides of your personality, and you can create highlights from anything you've already posted to your Story. From moments from your birthday dinner to moments of your vacation with friends. All these cherished memories, when shared on your Stories, can be saved and featured as Highlights on your Instagram profile.

An amazing feature of Instagram highlights is that you can group your stories into sections and create them as folder sections (i.e highlights) on your profile. Once you post a story, you can save it in a Highlight (which is like a folder) and that will automatically be featured on your profile permanently until you decide to delete it or archive it. With this tool, you can design your profile in a unique way that best expresses you.

## Part 2: How to Create Instagram Highlights from Stories Archive?

As mentioned above, Highlights are created through your Stories. You have two options for creating a Highlight. The first is that you either create a Highlight from a current Story or your Stories Archive.

Your Stories Archive is a feature that when enabled, ensures your Stories are automatically saved in your archive. Only you will be able to see them when the Stories have disappeared after 24 hours. If you need to check if this feature is active on your account, all you have to do is:

1. Go to your profile, click on the **menu** icon which is on the top right-hand corner of your profile. The **Menu Icon** is represented as three horizontal lines stacked on each other.
2. Tap on **Privacy**, then click on **Story**.
3. Scroll down till you see **Saving,** then turn on **Save story to archive.**

If you choose to create Highlights from your Stories archive, this is how you go about it:

1. Go to your profile, click on the circle (the circular icon) with a **plus** **sign**, located directly below your **bio** and **Edit** **profile** icon.
2. Scroll through the archived stories that are displayed, click the image or videos you want to turn into a Highlight.
3. Click the **Next** icon on the top right-hand corner of the page.
4. Type in the name you want for that particular Highlight, in the section created for typing.
5. You can choose to click **Edit** **Cover.** This feature enables you to create a custom cover for the Highlight or you can use the cover Instagram automatically assigns to it.
6. Then you click **Add.** The Highlight will immediately be displayed on your profile page.

Another way to create a highlight from archived stories is by;

* Open your Instagram profile, click on the squared **plus** **icon** located at the top right-hand corner of your profile.
* Click **Story highlight,** choose your image/video you want to use
* Click the **Next icon** located at the top right-handed corner
* Customize the name of the highlight
* Click **Add,** and then you are done creating a highlight.

Above are the ways to create highlights on Instagram from Archive. They are pretty easy as long as you follow instructions correctly.

* Once you click on Add to highlights, a page comes up and you can either add the story to an old highlight or create a new one by clicking the **plus sign** on the lower right-hand, customize the name and click **Add**

**OR**

* Open your profile, **tap and hold** the particular highlight icon.
* A menu pops up and then you click **Delete** **highlight**

If for instance, you decide that you want to remove some stories from a highlight, all you have to do it;
