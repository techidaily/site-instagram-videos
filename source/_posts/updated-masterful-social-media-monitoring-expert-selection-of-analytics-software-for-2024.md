You can only access this Instagram analytics tool from your phone, and you won't be able to keep track of posts you shared before you converted to a Facebook Business profile.

#### 4\. [Owlmetrics](https://owlmetrics.com/)

 A quick look at the list of features Owlmetrics provides is enough to explain why this Instagram analytics tool is regarded as one of the most advanced tools on the market.

Tracking and analyzing hashtags that generate the best response from the audience is easy with Owlmetrics.

#### 7\. [Sprout Social](https://sproutsocial.com/)
