## Part 3: How to Remove Background from Instagram Video without Green Effect Effects

Instagram has updated the app to support a longer video form named IGTV for content creators. Thanks to IGTV, it supports videos longer than 60 seconds on the main feed. IGTV only supports limited dimensional video, i.e., 4:5 a minimum and 9:16 maximum ratio.

However, Instagram also supports landscape videos, portrait videos, and square videos. Being a content creator, you need a good video editor to edit and remove the background of your Instagram videos. Well, we will recommend [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to edit your Instagram videos. It has the following benefits for editing an IGTV video via Filmora:

* You can customize your video or portrait to any ratio besides the common ratios. This can be done by opening **File-project Settings** and entering the ratio you want to customize your project.
* It supports several video audio formats and allows you to alter the frame rate, video speed, etc. You can upload the video on Instagram directly and many other social media websites once you are done editing.
* It also has built-in filters that are specially designed for IGTV videos. It also has numerous special effects for you to make your video look professional.
* You can even customize the video and add catchy text and subtitles to make it more engaging.
* The final video can be directly exported to social media platforms.

**Al Portrait in Filmora** is the best way to remove the background of an Instagram video without Green Screen Instagram effects. It can remove the background of IGTV video without affecting its movement and lighting. The following steps can assist you in knowing how to use it for removing the background.

Al Portrait is not a free module, so either you have to **Purchase** it or **Try it for free**. There are various assets under AI Portrait, to remove the video background and isolate the human, you need to add Human Segmentation to the timeline. **Play the video** once to check the segmentation of the effects that you have applied to your video.

## Part 3: How to Remove Background from Instagram Video without Green Effect Effects

Instagram has updated the app to support a longer video form named IGTV for content creators. Thanks to IGTV, it supports videos longer than 60 seconds on the main feed. IGTV only supports limited dimensional video, i.e., 4:5 a minimum and 9:16 maximum ratio.

However, Instagram also supports landscape videos, portrait videos, and square videos. Being a content creator, you need a good video editor to edit and remove the background of your Instagram videos. Well, we will recommend [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to edit your Instagram videos. It has the following benefits for editing an IGTV video via Filmora:

* You can customize your video or portrait to any ratio besides the common ratios. This can be done by opening **File-project Settings** and entering the ratio you want to customize your project.
* It supports several video audio formats and allows you to alter the frame rate, video speed, etc. You can upload the video on Instagram directly and many other social media websites once you are done editing.
* It also has built-in filters that are specially designed for IGTV videos. It also has numerous special effects for you to make your video look professional.
* You can even customize the video and add catchy text and subtitles to make it more engaging.
* The final video can be directly exported to social media platforms.

**Al Portrait in Filmora** is the best way to remove the background of an Instagram video without Green Screen Instagram effects. It can remove the background of IGTV video without affecting its movement and lighting. The following steps can assist you in knowing how to use it for removing the background.

### Step 2: Add the AI Portrait Effect to Remove Video Background

Al Portrait is not a free module, so either you have to **Purchase** it or **Try it for free**. There are various assets under AI Portrait, to remove the video background and isolate the human, you need to add Human Segmentation to the timeline. **Play the video** once to check the segmentation of the effects that you have applied to your video.

### Step 3: Adjust Effects

Different effects have different settings so that you can adjust the effects according to your convenience. You have to **double click** the video in the timeline and then go to the Video Effects to adjust the **Percentage, Edge thickness, Edge Feature, and Alpha** setting of the effect. You can also restore the changes you've made by selecting the **Restore** button.
