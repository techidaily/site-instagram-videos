Instagram reels are strikingly similar to TikTok and allow users to create their content by adding music to their videos. These videos can be 15 seconds long, allowing content creators to show their skills in just enough time to catch the user’s attention. You can edit and add effect to these and then post them.

This feature was recently introduced in India, and Instagram downloads went up by 11.4%. However, this feature is still new, and many people are unaware of it. So, we have listed all that you need to know about Instagram Reels and how you can **make Reels on Instagram**. Let’s dive in!

If you have a private account compliant with your settings and privacy, the video will only be visible to your followers. Your followers can use neither the original audio nor share it with people who don’t follow you.

If you have a public account, the video will be discoverable by a larger Instagram community. Considering the popularity, it will also stand a chance to land in the **Explore** section, where it can be viewed and shared by millions of other people.
