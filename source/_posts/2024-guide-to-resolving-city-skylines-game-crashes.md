So if your Cities: Skylines 2 crashes easily, one of the first things you need to check is whether your computer meets the minimum system requirements for the game. If your machine is below or just at the requirements, you may need to upgrade your hardware for Cities: Skylines 2 to run smoothly.

Here are the requirements for your reference:

## 2\. Make sure your computer is not running hot

 If the ventilation for your computer is rather poor, your machine may run hot. In addition, games usually consume more computer resources than other programs, and therefore add more pressure to your computer’s cooling system. So if your computer is overheated, there’s a bigger chance that your Cities: Skylines 2 crashes easily, among many other PC performance issues.

 If you can feel the heat on your computer case or on your computer itself, or you can hear the fan(s) running very loud when you play games, you need a better cooling system for your machine to make sure that Cities: Skylines 2 doesn’t crash.

 Here is a detailed post with instructions on how you can cool your computer down if your computer is overheating: **[How](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [**to Know Your CPU Overheating and How to Fix It**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## 3\. Update Windows

 If your system isn’t updated regularly, there could be problems with the outdated redistributables, DirectX, and/or other Windows patches, and thus cause Cities: Skylines 2 to crash. To make sure that you have the latest available updates installed:

1. On your keyboard, hit the**Windows** key, then type**check for update** s, then click C**heck for updates** .

## 4\. Update graphics card driver

 An outdated or incorrect display card driver could also be the culprit to your Cities: Skylines 2 crashing problem, so if the above methods don’t help Cities: Skylines 2 to stop crashing, it’s likely that you have a corrupted or outdated graphics driver. So you should update your drivers to see if it helps.

 There are mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.
