## Part 2: How to Add Music to Instagram Story with Music Sticker

Did I tell you that you can customize the music sticker? Oh, my bad. As we know that Instagram has a creative and diverse audience, the music sticker allows customizations. Now, what exactly does that mean?

* You can change the size and location of the music sticker on your story.
* You can choose to add lyrics to the song or choose to display it as a music player.
* The font of the lyric can also be changed
* You can even change the color of the music player or the lyrics
* Choose the length of the song (max 15seconds)

Now that you have gained access to the music sticker let's talk about how it can be used to add your favorite music.

1.Shoot a photo/video as an Instagram story or choose an older one from your gallery

2.Click on Stickers on the top and choose 'Music' from the stickers

3.Tap on Music, and you will be presented with a list of songs. Categorized as popular, genre, and moods so that you can quickly swipe through the desired list to choose a perfect piece. Or you can even search for a specific song in the search bar above

4.Preview the song by playing it in the app

5.Once you find that perfect song to go with your video, click Add. Voila!
