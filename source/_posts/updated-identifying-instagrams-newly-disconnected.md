## Part 4: How to Prevent Organic Followers from Unfollowing?

Organic followers are the followers that have followed you recently. These followers are somehow interested in your personality, posts, or what you show on your Instagram account. So, if you are an Instagram influencer, you would want to prevent people from unfollowing you. The best is by maintaining their expectations and hopes with your account. The following tips can assist you in preventing organic followers from unfollowing:

* **Going Live**

One of the most effective ways is going live on Instagram to know what people expect from you. You can let your followers see the real you to maintain an excellent relationship with them.

* **Stay Active**

If you are not staying active for whatever reason, there's a high chance people will start unfollowing you. You need to keep your feed presence by posting more often to prevent the organic followers from unfollowing you.

* **Engage with audience**

Start engaging with your follower, reply to their comments on your posts with interactive stickers. Otherwise, they would think that you are rude and will start unfollowing you. Also, try to engage on their posts as well.

### FAQs about Instagram Followers Tracking

#### 1\. Are you notified if someone unfollows you on Instagram?

The obvious answer to this question is no. Instagram does not notify if someone has unfollowed you due to any reason. Instagram tends to keep its user's privacy, and also it is against the application's privacy policy. But if you still want to know, you can either check manually or use a third-party app.

#### 2\. Is it immature to unfollow someone on Instagram?

It is not immature to unfollow someone if you have a legitimate reason. If you don't want to interact with someone or see their posts or stories, then it is mature to unfollow them for good. But to unfollow people for fun, then it is pretty immature.

#### 3\. How do I stop a follower from seeing my Instagram posts?

To hide your content from someone on Instagram, you will have to go to their Profile and click on three horizontal lines on the top right corner. A menu bar will appear. Select mute from that menu to stop that person from seeing your posts.

## Part 4: How to Prevent Organic Followers from Unfollowing?

Organic followers are the followers that have followed you recently. These followers are somehow interested in your personality, posts, or what you show on your Instagram account. So, if you are an Instagram influencer, you would want to prevent people from unfollowing you. The best is by maintaining their expectations and hopes with your account. The following tips can assist you in preventing organic followers from unfollowing:

* **Going Live**

One of the most effective ways is going live on Instagram to know what people expect from you. You can let your followers see the real you to maintain an excellent relationship with them.

* **Stay Active**

If you are not staying active for whatever reason, there's a high chance people will start unfollowing you. You need to keep your feed presence by posting more often to prevent the organic followers from unfollowing you.

* **Engage with audience**

Start engaging with your follower, reply to their comments on your posts with interactive stickers. Otherwise, they would think that you are rude and will start unfollowing you. Also, try to engage on their posts as well.

### FAQs about Instagram Followers Tracking

#### 1\. Are you notified if someone unfollows you on Instagram?

The obvious answer to this question is no. Instagram does not notify if someone has unfollowed you due to any reason. Instagram tends to keep its user's privacy, and also it is against the application's privacy policy. But if you still want to know, you can either check manually or use a third-party app.

#### 2\. Is it immature to unfollow someone on Instagram?

It is not immature to unfollow someone if you have a legitimate reason. If you don't want to interact with someone or see their posts or stories, then it is mature to unfollow them for good. But to unfollow people for fun, then it is pretty immature.

#### 3\. How do I stop a follower from seeing my Instagram posts?

To hide your content from someone on Instagram, you will have to go to their Profile and click on three horizontal lines on the top right corner. A menu bar will appear. Select mute from that menu to stop that person from seeing your posts.

To do that, they have to keep the check on their followers' counts. No one wants their follower count to decrease. But if that happens, then you would like to know who has unfollowed you. There are many ways to check it, but the most basic form of how to see who unfollowed you on Instagram is by inspecting manually. The following steps can assist you in that:

**Step 1: Launch the app**

First things first, you have to launch the Instagram app or website on your phone or on a computer.

**Step 2: Check the following**

Now, look at the following box in the profile of the person you want to check manually. If you don't see your profile in the **Following tab**, then you can assume that they have unfollowed you.
