And, if you're keeping up, you may be confronting the difficulty of switching the same video into different sizes for respective social media channels.

## Part 1: How to Auto Resize Videos for Instagram Stories, Feed, and IGTV on Mac?

Let's first have a brief discussion on Instagram's different aspect ratios for Stories, Reels, IGTV, and so on. Even though 95 million photos are being posted every day on Instagram, the video stats still perform better. The video posts tend to receive two times more comments than other kinds of posts.

For Instagram videos, you've to check around its five minimum or maximum resolution requirements based upon where and how you will post them.

* **Portrait Videos**

Minimum Resolution: 600 × 750; Maximum Resolution: 1080 × 1350

* **Square Videos**

Minimum Resolution: 600 × 600; Maximum Resolution: 1080 × 1080

* **Stories Videos**

Minimum Resolution: 600 × 1067; Maximum Resolution: 1080 × 1920

* **Landscape Videos**

Minimum Resolution: 600 × 315; Maximum Resolution: 1080 × 608

* **Carousel Videos**

Minimum Resolution: 600 × 700; Maximum Resolution: 1080 × 1080

Given below are **different aspect ratios of Instagram Videos**.

* Square - 1:1
* Portrait - 4:5
* Stories – 9:16
* Landscape – 1.91: 1 to 16:9
* Carousel – 1:1; 4:5; 16:9

So, you need to ensure compliance with the requirements mentioned above of Instagram Videos. We'd now like to introduce our best quick method to **resize** **the video to fit Instagram**.
