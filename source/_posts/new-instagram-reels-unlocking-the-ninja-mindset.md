* [Method 2: How To Make Reels Using with Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](#part2)

#### Method 1: How to Make an Instagram Reel With The Built-in Editor

1\. Open the **Instagram** application and tap on the camera icon in the top left of the screen.

![launch instagram app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/launch-instagram-app1.jpg)
