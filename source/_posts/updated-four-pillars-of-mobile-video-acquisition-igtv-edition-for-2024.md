## How to Download IGTV Videos on iPhone and Android Devices \[5 ways\]

Respecting the copyright laws is of utmost importance because the violation of intellectual property rights is considered a criminal offense. Posting the videos you downloaded from IGTV on your channel and claiming them as your own is considered illegal, so make sure that you have the necessary permission to upload a video before you share it on IGTV. Okay, let's have a look at different ways of downloading IGTV videos to a Smartphone.

So, once you’ve installed this app on your iPhone, you will be able to access the **Download from the Instagram** option that allows you to save Instagram stories, IGTV videos to your phone. In addition, you can use this option **to repost videos on your IGTV channel**, but you shouldn’t do this without permission from the creator whose video you downloaded. Simply **copy the URL** of the video you’d like to download and paste it into this [shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/424a14194efe44cfac0c409fdfa2b164). You can also **use the voice commands to ask Siri to launch the app for you**.

#### 2. Downloading IGTV Videos With Documents6 on iPhones

[Documents](https://readdle.com/documents) is basically a file manager that lets you view different types of files from an iPhone.

#### 3. Using the IGTV Video Downloader to Download Videos on Android

Saving IGTV videos to an Android phone is much faster and easier than downloading videos from IGTV to an iPhone. All you have to do is install the [IGTV Video Downloader](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.igtvdownloader.app) app on your device. The app can be downloaded from Google Play for free, but it contains ads, which can be somewhat frustrating. Launch the **Instagram app**, and head over to IGTV to select the video you want to download. **Copy the IGTV video’s link** and **paste it to the IGTV Video Downloader app**. Tap on the **Download button** and wait for the download process to be completed. The file will be stored in your phone’s gallery, so you can access it quickly and watch it whenever you want.

[Saveo](https://en.softonic.com/solutions/apps/saveo?rel=362940) is yet another Android app you can use to download videos from IGTV.

Tap on the **three-dot icon**, located next to the Like and Comment options, and then tap on the **Copy Link** property. You will be then taken back to the Saveo app where you just have to tap on the **Download button**, and the download process will commence immediately. You can keep track of the download progress in your phone’s notification bar.

After installing and launching the [Keep It Video Downloader for Instagram and IGTV](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nexa.xsaver.photovideodownloader&hl=en%5F), you just have to tap on the **Start Service option** in order to enable it. Tap on the **Open Instagram** button and then click on the **three-dot icon** and select the **Copy Link option**. The download will start as soon as you copy the video’s link and you can download multiple videos simultaneously. All videos you download will be stored in the app’s **My Downloads folder**, so you can watch them or share them effortlessly.
