You can add people to Video chat by following the steps above; they will be added to this thread, but keep in mind that only 6 people can be in the video chat at the same time.

Remember that anyone who has sent you a direct message can video chat with you. You can simply ban or mute someone who is video chatting with you if you want to prevent them from doing so.

## Things You Should Pay Attention To While Using Youtube Video Chat

* Set up your gadget or camera so that it can see you clearly and unobstructedly. Sit as far away from (or as near to) the camera as possible. If you're using a different camera, situate it close to your screen, ideally at eye level, so that while you're looking at the screen, it appears as if you're looking at the person you're talking to.
* Before you post personal information, think twice. This could contain things like where you reside, where you go to school, and your home address.
* Protect your account information, and don't give out your password to anybody else. You will never be asked for your password by a YouTube employee. Don't be deceived if someone claims to be from YouTube and contacts you.
* First and foremost, obtain authorization. Before shooting or posting other people's personal information, get their permission first.
* Gor a list of tools to manage your content and experience on the site, go to the Privacy and Safety Settings page.
* Take a look at some of the best practices for keeping your Google Account safe.
* Google account security is improved so, Keep your accounts safe.

## Conclusion

**●** Making an Instagram video chat allows you to experiment with new ways to remain in touch with your friends while using the app. While Instagram video chats aren't likely to replace WhatsApp or FaceTime, they are a terrific way to remain in touch with friends while reading through your Instagram feed. We expect businesses to experiment with using video chat to communicate with customers as Instagram develops. It can undoubtedly become a new approach to communicating with your followers to keep them involved and satisfied with your services.

**●** Keep in mind that anyone who has sent you a direct message can video chat with you. You can easily block or mute someone who is video chatting with you to prevent them from doing so. Video conferencing is ideal for groups. You can video chat with your buddies for as long as you want if you have a good internet connection. Simply tap the red phone icon at the bottom of the screen to exit the video conversation.
