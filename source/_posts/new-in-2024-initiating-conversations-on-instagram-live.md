Instagram is a free photo and video-sharing social networking platform. Since its inception, Instagram has grown in popularity as a method to engage with brands, celebrities, thought leaders, friends, family, and more. The launch of Instagram's IGTv function was a great success, and the platform isn't stopping there. Soon later, in the summer of 2019, Instagram added a new feature: you may now video chat with one or more of your friends in direct messaging without having to leave Instagram. This innovation will help Instagram to retain its users on the platform for longer than before, obviating the need for third-party programs such as Skype and Facetime.

#### When Is It Introduced?

Instagram is the most popular social networking platform in the world. It was a huge hit right away, with over a million users only two months after it went up. Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger created Instagram in San Francisco.

Instagram was started on October 6, 2010, and it grew almost instantly. From a small number of users, it quickly grew to become the most popular photography app, with 100,000 users in one week and one million in two months. According to Kevin Systrom, the software took only eight weeks to develop yet was the culmination of a year's worth of work. Facebook eventually purchased it for $1 billion in 2012\. It now has over 600 million active users and continues to grow rapidly.

#### How Many People Can You Video Chat With?

Instagram is one of the most popular social media platforms, with millions of users regularly. Users can share their photos, stories, and other content with their followers on a private or public account. Like other social media programs such as Facebook Messenger and Microsoft Skype, Instagram allows users to video chat with one another. So that you may keep in touch with your friends, family, and teammates. The best part is that you don't need a phone number to make an Instagram video call; all you need is excellent Internet access. You can even invite someone to join a video chat that is already in progress.

Now, if you're wondering how many individuals you can video chat with, the answer is, Instagram allows you to video chat with up to 6 people.

#### Will Instagram Video Chat Show Your Face?

If you're in an Instagram Direct group discussion and there's an active Video Chat, the camera icon in the top-right corner of your thread will become blue. You only need to tap the camera icon to join in the fun! You can also talk for as long as you want on Video Chat because there is no time limit. Remember that when you minimize a Video Chat, you will be the only one who can see what's on your screen! And unless your pals also limit their chat, they'll be able to see your face as you browse.

You may wonder if you can turn off your camera on an Instagram video call. Those who want to use the features can find them at the bottom of their screens while doing an Instagram live. Users will mute the audio by tapping the microphone button or turning off the video camera by tapping the video camera button.

#### Will You Get Charged For Making A Video Call On Instagram?

Instagram is another of the best free international calling applications. Finally, you may use Instagram to make free audio or video chat with that person and have an uninterrupted conversation. Furthermore, you may minimize the video chat and multitask on Instagram, sending messages and photos in Direct, surfing your feed, creating a story, and more while on the video chat.

#### What Will Show On Your Phone When Somebody Calls You On Instagram?

When someone video calls you, you will receive notifications on your phone similar to regular ringing, and when you pick up or accept the call, they will be able to speak with you through video call.

You might be thinking, "How do I get Instagram video call notifications?" Go to your profile's gear icon and look under Push Notifications for the new video chat settings to update your video chat notifications.

## How To Use Instagram Video Chat?

You can use video chat on Instagram by following this step-by-step guide. But, before you depart, keep in mind that Direct Messaging allows you to video chat with up to 6 people.

If you're using a different camera, situate it close to your screen, ideally at eye level, so that while you're looking at the screen, it appears as if you're looking at the person you're talking to.
* Before you post personal information, think twice. This could contain things like where you reside, where you go to school, and your home address.
* Protect your account information, and don't give out your password to anybody else. You will never be asked for your password by a YouTube employee. Don't be deceived if someone claims to be from YouTube and contacts you.
* First and foremost, obtain authorization. Before shooting or posting other people's personal information, get their permission first.
* Gor a list of tools to manage your content and experience on the site, go to the Privacy and Safety Settings page.
