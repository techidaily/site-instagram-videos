### Step 1: Browse for filters

Swipe left on the main page of the Instagram app to open the Instagram stories, then tap the **magnifying glass** on the bottom of the page to browse different filter effects.

### Step 2: Preview a filter of your choice

Scroll through the filters and choose the Filter you wish to preview. You can also use the glass icon to search for more filters by entering a name or keyword. When you tap, a **preview screen** appears. You can also download the Filter by tapping on the down arrow button.

### Step 3: Take the snap

Once you've narrowed down the Filter of your choice, **snap a photo** or record a video with the Filter, then share it with your friends or save it to post it wherever you like.
