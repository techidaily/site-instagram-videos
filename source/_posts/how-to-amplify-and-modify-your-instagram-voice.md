## Part 2: Types of Instagram Voice Filters

There are five voice filters available. Each of them is unique, and depending on your mood and requirements, you can pick a voice filter.

**Helium:** The first voice filter is helium. It makes your voice sound as if you have inhaled the helium gas. As a result, your voice will sound squishy and cute.

Giant: If you love a giant voice, try the giant voice because it will make you sound completely different!

**Vocalist:** The vocalist filter makes your voice sound incredibly soothing and melodic. If you like soft voice, this is the filter to go for.

**Announcer:** The announcer filter will let you speak like a real announcer. It has echo effects too!

**Robot:** The last one is the robot filter, where you will sound like a robot. This one makes you sound like you are from outer space.

## Part 2: Types of Instagram Voice Filters

There are five voice filters available. Each of them is unique, and depending on your mood and requirements, you can pick a voice filter.

**Helium:** The first voice filter is helium. It makes your voice sound as if you have inhaled the helium gas. As a result, your voice will sound squishy and cute.

Giant: If you love a giant voice, try the giant voice because it will make you sound completely different!

**Vocalist:** The vocalist filter makes your voice sound incredibly soothing and melodic. If you like soft voice, this is the filter to go for.

**Announcer:** The announcer filter will let you speak like a real announcer. It has echo effects too!

**Robot:** The last one is the robot filter, where you will sound like a robot. This one makes you sound like you are from outer space.

## Part 3: How to Change Voice in Instagram Reel?

Just like you can change your voice when filming a story, you can try the same voice-changing filter while recording a reel.

Here’s what you need to do:

**Step 1:** Go to your Instagram account and click on your profile picture with the + icon. And then click on the Reels option.

![create Instagram Reels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-instagram-reels.jpg)

**Step 2:** On your left, you will see the filter option; please click on that. When the filters appear, look at the top of the filters, and you will see a search bar. There, you need to type voice effects.

![add voice effect in Instagram Reels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-voice-effects-instagram-reels.jpg)
