## Leveraging Descriptive Power for 3 Engaging Instagram Video Stories

Are you fond of using Instagram? Instagram is one of the widely used social media platforms that many people use to connect with each other. You can share photos, videos, and stories with your followers to provide a highlight of your daily activities and experiences.

Moreover, you can use filters provided on Instagram to make your photos or videos more engaging. You can also add captions to them to easily reach your target audience. In this article, you can learn **how to add captions to Instagram videos** efficiently. We will highlight three different ways that can assist you in adding captions to your Instagram videos.

## Part 1: Why Should You Add Captions to Instagram Videos?

Have you ever wondered what the benefits of adding captions to Instagram videos are? Read this part of the article to know the actual reasons for adding captions to Instagram:

If you are posting movie trailers on Instagram, there are chances that people won't understand the dialogue immediately. To make your movie trailers more understandable, it's recommended to add captions before posting them as Instagram videos.

### 2\. Helps During Sound Issues

Sound issues on your Instagram videos may occur unexpectedly. In such situations, adding captions to Instagram videos can help those users who face audio problems frequently.

### 3\. Accessible to Deaf People

Being a blogger or influencer on Instagram, it's your responsibility to make your content accessible to physically disabled people. Thus, adding captions to your Instagram videos can help deaf individuals to understand and connect with your content.

### 4\. Connects with a Wide Audience
