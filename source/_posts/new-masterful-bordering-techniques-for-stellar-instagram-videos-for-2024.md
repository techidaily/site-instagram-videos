**Step 3:** The clip will appear under the **Videos** section in the **Uploads** category. To view the clip in the editing window, click on it. You may move the video around by dragging it.

(**Note:** If you'd rather use vibrant colors than plain old white borders, the color tab (top) provides a large color pallet to select from, as shown below).
