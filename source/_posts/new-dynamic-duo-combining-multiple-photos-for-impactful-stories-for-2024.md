## Creative Instagram Story Ideas to Engage Your Audience

I hope you have now learned how to put multiple pictures on the Instagram story at ease, but are you sure that your followers would find them attractive? Are you a blogger or a business expert looking out for ideas to engage and create a wow factor around your audience on Instagram? Here are top ideas picked exclusively for your reach that is creative as well as breathtaking.

#### 1\. Go live

The first and foremost idea to engage conversation and get involved with followers is to go on a live video in Insta. While live videos involve real-time facilities, it allows one to directly interact with questions, answers, comments, and other ideas from the user side.

#### 2\. Giveaways and contests

The best option to go with event organizers or brand promoters is the idea of contests and giveaways. Without a doubt, it will turbocharge the engagement numbers leading to excitement and a raise in your follower's club. Like the free trial of service, a sample of the product, you can pick a price for the winner.

#### 3\. Promote Instagram posts

Besides sharing your posts in your Instagram story, try promoting other Insta posts in your story like sharing your posts of any of your followers. It would create fun and close collaboration among your followers.

#### 4\. Conduct a poll

How about asking questions to your followers with a survey on your story? Insta offers poll sticker options with which you can ask questions that would engage your viewers. You can promote your brand else have a fun time too.

#### 5\. Promote products

You can promote a brand or your product with your Insta stories as well. Is there any product on the market? You can announce its arrival, get feedback, and promote them in turn. Online courses, combo packages of healthy products, and so on, come up in the list.

#### 6\. Use IGTV

Ever heard of IGTV (Instagram TV), Instagram's standalone video app launched in 2018 aiding creators to make-up long-form videos? It is an excellent idea of sharing exciting news or video content to your followers in provoking engagement.

#### 7\. Share your creative talent

Give a glimpse of creating roses with Saturn ribbons or a tray with newspaper leftover if you are right. Besides sharing videos or products, post a video of building a craft project, making an easy savory recipe that is the best one to grab a wow factor.

Insta stories are the best fun crackers and fan club fillers as well. With the introduction to a simple guide on how to put multiple pictures on the Instagram story, this marks the end of today's article!!
