## How to zoom in/out in Instagram Stories

We know a video in 'Rewind' mode is pretty cute and funny, as the chain of events occurs in the reverse order. So, to zoom in/out while shooting one such video in 'Rewind' mode, you need to press the record button and then swipe up/down your finger, just like in the 'Normal' mode. Here also, if you remove your finger, the recording will stop. Master how to zoom in Instagram Stories, while recording in 'Rewind' mode.

#### 3\. Boomerang

Shooting a video in 'Boomerang' is exciting while creating Instagram Stories. We will explain to you how to zoom in/out Instagram Stories in 'Superzoom' mode in Boomerang. Press your record button longer and slide your finger up/down to zoom in/out, while recording the video for your Insta Stories.

There are two-options while you want to zoom in/out using the 'Hands-Free' mode. You can pinch the screen and zoom in or out prior to recording the video. Now, tap the record button, the video will be automatically recorded after a few seconds. Remember! You are using the 'Hands-Free' mode, so no holding the record button. The second method is similar to the previous methods of zooming in/out videos for Instagram Stories. Tap the record button and wait till the point where you want to zoom in/out. At that very point, hold the record button and slide your finger up/down to zoom in/out the video. This is how to zoom in/out Instagram Stories using 'Hands-Free' mode.

Be it a 'Boomerang', 'Rewind', 'Hands-Free', or 'Normal' mode video, learning how to zoom in Instagram Stories is sure to make your stories cool and funky.
