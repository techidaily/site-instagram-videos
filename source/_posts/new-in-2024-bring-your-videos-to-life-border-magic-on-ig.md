![add instagram to filmora timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-instagram-video-timeline.jpg)

**Step 4**: To add borders to the video for Instagram, select the **Effect** tab present on the horizontal menu.

**Step 5**: In the **Effects** tab, look for the **Utility** option to open an array of effects, such as **Mosaic,** **Shape Mask, Auto Enhance, Image Mask**, and **Borders**.
