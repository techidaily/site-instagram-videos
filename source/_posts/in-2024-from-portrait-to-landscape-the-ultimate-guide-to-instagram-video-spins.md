## Why Rotate Videos for Instagram?

Have you ever captured a video in landscape or horizontal mode on your smartphone, only to realize it's not quite right for Instagram? The platform is optimized for portrait or vertical videos, so videos captured in landscape mode may not fit the screen properly. This leads to having black bars on the sides or a distorted aspect ratio. To correct this, you must rotate the video to fit the screen perfectly.

By rotating your videos, you can ensure that your content is properly oriented and displayed for maximum impact on the platform. Whether you need to rotate a video 90 degrees or adjust it slightly, the process is simple and can be done on both desktop and mobile devices.

#### Q1\. How Do I Rotate a Video Before Posting it on Instagram?

This can be frustrating for users who have taken the time to capture a great video but need to share it as intended on the platform.

There are a few reasons why videos may appear sideways on Instagram. One of the most common causes is that the device's orientation was not properly set when the video was captured. Sometimes, videos may also appear sideways due to a glitch in the app or software used to capture the video.

#### Q2\. Why Are My Videos Sideways on Instagram?

Videos appearing sideways on Instagram is a common issue that occurs when a video is captured in landscape mode or horizontal orientation instead of portrait mode. When this happens, the video may not fit properly on the screen and appear distorted or sideways when posted on Instagram. This can be frustrating for users who have taken the time to capture a great video but need to share it as intended on the platform.

There are a few reasons why videos may appear sideways on Instagram. One of the most common causes is that the device's orientation was not properly set when the video was captured. Sometimes, videos may also appear sideways due to a glitch in the app or software used to capture the video.

To avoid videos appearing sideways on Instagram, it's important to always capture videos in portrait mode, set the orientation of your device correctly, and edit your videos to ensure they fit properly on the platform.

#### Q3\. What Is the Fastest Way to Rotate a Video on iPhone/Android?

The fastest way to rotate a video on iPhone or Android is to use a third-party app. Several video editing apps are available for iOS and Android devices, but one of the most popular and user-friendly options is Filmora for Mobile. This app is designed specifically for mobile devices and provides a range of features for editing and enhancing your videos.
