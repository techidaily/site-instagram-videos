## Why Share Your IGTV Video on Your Story?

You might not know this, but the “Story” feature on Instagram is already used by over 500 million people and the app is still trying to push it. When you post a video on IGTV, chances are that it might get missed by your viewers. This is because the new Instagram algorithm only displays selective content in our feed.

On the other hand, all stories posted by the accounts that we follow will be displayed on the top banner of our Instagram home. Therefore, chances are that more people would see your story instead of a regular post. By sharing your IGTV video as your story, you can easily redirect your audience and let them know about the new content that you have posted.

## A Step-by-step Guide for Sharing an IGTV Video on Instagram Story

One of the best things about Instagram is that you can share almost anything on your story. If you want, you can easily share your own post or IGTV video. Besides that, if you wish to promote your friends, then you can share their IGTV video on your story as well. You can even customize it with the inbuilt markups available in the Story interface. To learn how to share IGTV video on the Instagram story, just follow these steps.

#### 1. Select the IGTV Video to Share

To start with, you have to select what you wish to share on your Instagram story. You can visit yours or anyone else’s profile and tap on the IGTV icon. By default, it is the second icon (between your photo grid and photos of you).

Once the IGTV video would start playing, you can tap on the share icon from the bottom of the screen. This is depicted by a tilted arrow icon right next to the like and comment options.
