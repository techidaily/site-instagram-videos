## 10 Best Video Editing Apps to edit IGTV video for iOS and Android

You have to go through the list of IGTV’s technical specifications, before you start editing your video, in order to know the maximum duration of a video you can share on IGTV or the maximum size of a video file you can share on your IGTV channel. Okay, let's have a look at the ten best video editing apps you can use to edit the videos you upload to IGTV.

#### 1. [iMovie](https://apps.apple.com/qa/app/imovie/id377298193)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS

Die-hard fans of Apple’s products can edit their videos with iMovie, not only on their iPhone but on iPad and iPod as well. There are 8 themes you can choose from that also contain preset transitions and titles, so you just have to add your footage and let iMovie do the rest for you. Moreover, the app offers slow-motion, split-screen, and PIP features as well as ten video filters so you can easily overlay two video clips or enhance the colors in a video. You can also record voiceovers, import songs from your music library, or add sound effects to the audio files you use in your projects.

#### 2. [Quik](https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/quik-app-video-photo-editor)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android

Besides video files you can also add up to 75 photos to the IGTV videos you create with the Quik app. The app is perfectly optimized for processing the footage captured with GoPro cameras, but that doesn’t mean you can’t use it to edit videos captured with other devices. There are 23 themes with graphics and transitions you can use to quickly create a video and you can customize each theme by adjusting the fonts, graphics, and filters. The app lets you change the aspect ratio quickly, so you just have to select the portrait option, in order to make your video perfectly suited for IGTV. You can see how the YouTubers such as Jake Rich edit videos on iPhone with GoPro Quik from the video above.
