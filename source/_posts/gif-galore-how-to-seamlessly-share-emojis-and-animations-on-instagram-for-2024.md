#### Step 1\. Open the Filmora software

Wondershare Filmora application should be opened on your computer after downloading it. Then, you upload the gif file that you choose into the Filmora program.

#### Step 2\. Editing your gif

You can then edit the gif by adding text, music and different colors.

#### Step 4\. Upload to Instagram

Lastly, open up the Instagram app, choose the desired video from your image gallery, edit, add a written description and upload it to your profile for the world to see.

### Method 2: Using Giphy app to upload and share your favorite gif directly to Instagram

[Giphy](https://giphy.com/apps) is a popular GIF collection and community site, it also allows you to search your favorite gifs and then post them to social networks like Facebook, Twitter, as well as Instagram. It will convert and save the gif as a 15-second MP4 video into your camera roll for you to open it in an Instagram post directly.

One of Giphy's shortage is that it's too slow, if you want to trim a video quickly and free, you can choose [Filmora's free video trimmer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/),

which allows you to trim a video online without registration request, and totally free.

**Step 1:** Once you've downloaded the application, it will ask for your authority to access your camera on your smartphone before you are able to start your first GIF-like video.

**Step 3:** Choose a purple box with an Instagram symbol in the Sharing options, then Giphy will try to open your Instagram app. Go and open your Instagram app, and post the video file you just generated with Giphy.

You have the option to crop your clip, use filters to put different effects, and place your small image before adding text below it to describe your GIF video to the world. After you post your video, it will play and automatically show your mini video from beginning to finish in your follower's news feeds.

It will have a label showing that it is a Boomerang video. Your followers can click on the app and download it as well for themselves.

### Frequently Asked Questions about Uploading GIFs to Instagram

#### 1\. Can I upload GIFs to Instagram?

Adding GIFs directly to your Instagram feed is an option you have at your disposal, but the platform is going to treat an entire GIF as a single frame and you’ll end up posting a still image instead of a GIF.

However, there is a quick workaround for this issue, as you can simply convert a GIF file into a [video file format Instagram supports](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and upload your GIF as a video.

Installing the GIPHY app on your Smartphone is another option you have because the app allows its users to share GIFs from their collection directly to Instagram.

#### 2\. How to find the best GIFs on Instagram?

Currently, Instagram doesn’t have a collection of GIFs you can add to your feed, but it does offer a rich selection of GIFs that can be added to Instagram stories. Once you upload the content you want to include in your story, you should tap on the Sticker icon and choose the GIF option.

You can then start browsing through Instagram’s collection of GIF stickers, so you just have to tap on the option you like and proceed to adjust its size and position on the screen.

## Conclusion

Now you know how to post gifs on Instagram. If you have any other ideas that can also upload a gif onto Instagram, leave your comments and let us know!
