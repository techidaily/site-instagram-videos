## Part 3: How to Remove Background from Instagram Video without Green Effect Effects

Instagram has updated the app to support a longer video form named IGTV for content creators. Thanks to IGTV, it supports videos longer than 60 seconds on the main feed. IGTV only supports limited dimensional video, i.e., 4:5 a minimum and 9:16 maximum ratio.

However, Instagram also supports landscape videos, portrait videos, and square videos. Being a content creator, you need a good video editor to edit and remove the background of your Instagram videos. Well, we will recommend [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to edit your Instagram videos. It has the following benefits for editing an IGTV video via Filmora:

### Step 2: Add the AI Portrait Effect to Remove Video Background

Al Portrait is not a free module, so either you have to **Purchase** it or **Try it for free**. There are various assets under AI Portrait, to remove the video background and isolate the human, you need to add Human Segmentation to the timeline. **Play the video** once to check the segmentation of the effects that you have applied to your video.
