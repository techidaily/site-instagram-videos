#### 5\. [VidLab](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vidlab-video-editor-movies/id791557660?mt=8)

As its name suggests, this app looks like a video editing laboratory that enables you to create video collages, add animated text over videos and even create your own fonts. VidLab is also a superb audio editing tool that allows you to import music from iTunes and add it to a video you want to share on Instagram.

Fading in or fading out music you add to your videos is also an option VidLab offers, and the app grants access to an impressive library of sound effects to its users as well. The VidLab app can be downloaded for free, although it is only available to iPhone users.

### Adding Music to Instagram Stories

The ephemeral content is rising in popularity every day, which is the reason why Instagram Stories are rapidly becoming an integral part of our daily routines. As most of you already know, these videos must be recorded with the Instagram app, and for that reason, you can't really use any of the video or sound editing apps you would normally use to add music to the videos you post on this photo and video sharing platform.

Using apps like Spotify to play music while recording your Instagram stories is currently the only way to add music to an Instagram story video. You should launch the Spotify app or any other app you choose, and then launch the Instagram app. If you would like to use a particular part of a song, simply pause the song at that section.

In order to start recording an Instagram story, you'll need to tap on the camera icon that is located in the upper left corner of the app's screen. Use the Control Center to switch to the app from which you want to play music from and hit play. Head back to the Instagram app and start recording your story while the music is playing. The 15-second video will be added to your Story after you click on the + icon.

### Conclusion

Adding music to your Instagram stories and videos will make them more dynamic and fun to watch. Let us know in the comments which apps for adding music to Instagram videos you like to use the most and feel free to share this article if you think that your friends should know about these great ways to add music to Instagram stories and videos.
