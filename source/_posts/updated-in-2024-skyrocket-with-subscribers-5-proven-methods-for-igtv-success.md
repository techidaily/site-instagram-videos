 Regardless of the industry you’re in, social media can help you promote the products or services your brand is offering and if used correctly they can also give a significant boost to your company’s revenue streams. Until recently Instagram was a platform that was mainly dedicated to photos because the duration of the videos you could upload to your account was limited to just sixty seconds. All of that has changed in June 2018, when Instagram launched IGTV which lets you[upload videos that last up to one hour](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). But the videos you share on your IGTV channel need an audience, so in this article, we are going to show you five ways to increase the number of followers you have on your IGTV account.

## How to Get More Followers on IGTV?

 Just uploading videos to your IGTV channel and leaving them there is far from enough to ensure each of your posts receives the attention it deserves. Perhaps the most important thing is to know the audience you are targeting as it will allow you to create the content that is more appealing to the ideal viewer of your IGTV videos. Let’s have a look at a few methods you can use to get more followers on IGTV.

**Tips and tricks:** [Converting YouTube video and Posting it on IGTV>>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 1. Optimize Your Profile to Gain More Followers

 Every detail matters, from the name of your channel to the thumbnail picture you select for each of the videos you add to your IGTV channel. Putting keywords that best reflect what your business or your videos are about into your Instagram profile is important because by doing so your IGTV channel will be much easier to find. Even if you already have a big social media following, using keywords in your profile may get you a step closer to expanding the audience your IGTV videos can reach.

#### 2. Discover the Best Time to Post New Videos and Share New Content Frequently

 Once again, knowing your audience and when they are the most likely to be using IGTV is essential for boosting the number of followers. The time zone in which your ideal viewer lives in or their age play an important role in choosing the time when you post new content to your IGTV channel. In general, the best time to post new videos on IGTV is from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. from Monday to Thursday, but you should try posting at different times of the day and see what produces the best results.

 Posting new videos on your IGTV channel regularly is probably more important than sharing videos at an exact same time because your followers will gradually learn your posting habits. Upload new content at least once a week and do your best to stick to your posting schedule. Pick one or more days when you share videos and your followers will always know when they can expect your new content.

#### 3. Share Your IGTV Videos on Facebook and Other Social Media

 IGTV is a relatively new platform, which means that it still doesn’t have as many users as social networks such as Facebook or Twitter. That is the reason why you shouldn’t focus exclusively on IGTV in your social media marketing efforts because you can amass a large number of followers on all popular social media platforms. Sharing an IGTV video on Facebook, for example, can help you gain access to a larger audience since you will enable your current followers to share your videos with their friends on that platform. In addition, the people who like the videos you post on your IGTV channel can become your followers, even if they found out about your IGTV channel on some other social network.

#### 4. Improve the Quality of the Content Constantly

 Both the topics of your IGTV videos and their quality matter, so if you are just starting out you should strive to improve the overall quality of the content you post on your channel through time. Purchasing a camera that is capable of recording HD or 4K videos and all other equipment that is necessary for the production of professional-looking videos can help you capture the videos in better quality. However, the stories your videos tell are equally important, which is why you need to choose the topics of your IGTV videos carefully. Writing a script for each new IGTV video you’re planning on shooting should make it easier for you to create captivating content that is going to attract new followers.

#### 5. Interact and Connect With IGTV Users

 Dedicate time to discovering the most influential IGTV users in your niche, and then make an effort to connect with them. A simple mention from someone who already has thousands of followers can do miracles for your IGTV account, which makes networking one of the most significant parts of the process of gathering new followers. Furthermore, you should reply to all the comments on your videos, and use every opportunity to interact with the followers you already have. By doing so, you will show your appreciation for the support your channel is already receiving, which may prompt some of your followers to recommend your IGTV account to their friends.

**Conclusion**

 Each niche of IGTV videos is slightly different, and the methods you’re going to utilize to increase the number of followers you have on your channel depends on the type of content you are posting on this platform. The best time of the day to share new IGTV videos or which keywords you include in your profile depend on the audience you’re targeting, so you must do thorough research of the market before you start uploading videos to your IGTV channel.
