## How to Add Highlights to Instagram Profile?

Once you have created a highlight, that highlight will appear on your profile. If you have not created a highlight yet, you will need to create your first highlight from a story for you to see anything on your profile. After the first highlight has been made, you can create additional highlights and name them accordingly simply by clicking the new button.

If a highlight does not show up on your profile, check that you have a unique name for the highlight and that you have followed all of the steps needed to create the graphic, naming, and story selections properly. Remember it is best not to have too many highlights on your profile as this could cause confusion for the visitor.

## How to Use Highlights and Story Links to Increase Conversions?

Generally, stories disappear after 24 hours if they are just posted to your profile. The ability to create highlights puts the stories into the profile until the highlight is deleted using the methods previously mentioned. If you happen to forget to add a story to your highlights within 24 hours, you can still access the story in your archives. Instagram automatically archives stories, meaning that the content you wish to save for a later date can be kept in the archive until you wish to put that material into a highlight.

Highlights ensure that visitors to your Instagram do not have to scroll through the content of your profile to find information concerning your brand. Additionally, by creating content-saturated Highlights, you set the tone for the viewer.

Businesses should understand how to create a highlight on Instagram as the potential for conversions is substantial when using them. Primarily, the highlight feature allows a business or a brand to re-introduce a story as new content with new promotional links. This means that stories which in the past showed a high user interaction can be reused and increase SERPs for that content for your brand. Use the methods on how to create highlights on Instagram from archives or how to make highlights on Instagram to showcase your stories.

Although the highlights are essential to brand building and conversions, they should be coupled with the Swipe-up feature, tap-to-view link features, and the content therein. Brands that have annual or semi-annual events should merge bits from prior stories with new content.

**Conclusion**

Instagram has over 200 million daily views making it the perfect platform for visual branding and sharing content. Categorizing your stories and content in a concise method is fundamental to establishing a high level of conversions. Highlights which appear on your profile under your bio are the best way in which to share stories and otherwise archived content with your viewers.

By following these simple methods of how to make a highlight on Instagram, whether you wish to do so for professional purposes or just to organize your stories on your personal account, you will find more interaction and more content-driven reactions to your profile.
