## Does the video verification work?

No, the video verification does not work optimally in finding fake profiles. The basic concept behind this verification process is scanning the face attributes like the Face ID authorization implemented in the gadgets. The pitfall in this method is that the app recognizes a doll as a real profile by the verification methodology at Instagram.
