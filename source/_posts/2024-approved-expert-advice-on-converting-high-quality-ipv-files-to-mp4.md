## Method 1—Convert Instagram Video to MP4 Using an Online Converter

What is an online Instagram to MP4 converter? Let's take a quick look!

InstagramSave, as the name itself suggests, is a free, yes you read it right, 100% free converter. It is available worldwide and requires no installation. All you need is an internet connection, and you're good to go. Are you excited yet? But hold your horses, because these aren't the only perks that InstagramSave offers. Apart from being hassle-free and easy to access, it provides a few more benefits:

* Download high-quality videos in their original resolution
* Only an Instagram video's URL is needed
* Save a video from any Instagram page like home feed, status, or explore page
* Available on iPhone, Android as well as on PC
* Fast and easy to use

Now, get ready to download and binge-watch unlimited, high-resolution videos in 5 simple steps.

1\. CHOOSE VIDEO: Open the video that you are crushing over and wish to download to be watched repeatedly and that too in excellent resolution.

2\. COPY URL: Tap the three dots on the top right corner of the desired video and click on 'Copy Link,' which is the URL in the boring tech language, so don't confuse yourself and follow my lead.

## Method 2—Convert Instagram Video to MP4 Using an Offline Converter

Wondershare Uniconverter is a one-stop-shop with an impressive number of features. It can be used after installation to convert your videos without needing an internet connection.

## CONCLUSION

The bottom line is that we discussed the two main methods of converting your favorite Instagram videos to MP4\. It doesn't matter whether you have an internet connection or not. You will be able to convert either way. Both offline and online Instagram to MP4 converter is very efficient. Still, in my personal opinion, Wondershare Uniconverter takes the lead due to its additional advanced editing tools.

Another essential media creator, namely Filmora, is not to be ignored while making videos. Filmora has proved to be the best and easiest video creator and editor requiring no expertise. If you're looking to create exceptionally fascinating videos, Filmora is the answer to your prayers.
