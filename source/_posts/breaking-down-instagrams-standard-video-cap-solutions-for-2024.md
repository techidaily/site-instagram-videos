Since Instagram's debut in 2010, it has become one of the most popular social media platforms globally. The app is optimized for mobile devices which are perfect for today's technological age. Users love communicating via high-quality pictures and videos with their friends and followers.

As users demand more ways to communicate, Instagram has been including additional features but with some limitations, requiring them to go through a complicated procedure to accomplish their goals such as uploading longer videos.

Instagrammers can capture videos, share them via direct message or on their account, and post them as a story. Unfortunately, these videos come with time limits. The length of the Instagram video depends on the type of content users wish to upload. Here’s a breakdown of the video length requirements for different types.

Since Instagram's debut in 2010, it has become one of the most popular social media platforms globally. The app is optimized for mobile devices which are perfect for today's technological age. Users love communicating via high-quality pictures and videos with their friends and followers.

As users demand more ways to communicate, Instagram has been including additional features but with some limitations, requiring them to go through a complicated procedure to accomplish their goals such as uploading longer videos.

Instagrammers can capture videos, share them via direct message or on their account, and post them as a story. Unfortunately, these videos come with time limits. The length of the Instagram video depends on the type of content users wish to upload. Here’s a breakdown of the video length requirements for different types.

* **Instagram Feed Limits**: These videos typically have a minimum uploading range from 3 seconds to a maximum 60 seconds video length.
* **Instagram Stories Limits:** Videos are limited to 15 seconds. However, users can create multiple clips and share them as combined stories for longer than 15 seconds.
* **IGTV Clips Limits:** Users can make and upload video clips for up to 60 minutes using IGTV. Regular Instagram account holders can post IGTV videos from 15 seconds to 10 minutes. However, video clips having a minimum 4:5 aspect ratio and maximum 5:4 video size limit will require a Mac in MP4 format.
* **Instagram Live Broadcast Limits:** Live broadcast videos have a limit of up to 60 minutes maximum.
