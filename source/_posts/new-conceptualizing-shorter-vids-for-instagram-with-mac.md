* IGTV, it’s between **15 seconds to 10 minutes** for non-verified accounts. For verified accounts, it gets cut at 60 minutes.

This can draw attention to your Instagram viewers resulting in more engagement.                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Corrects missing timestamps  | When recording Instagram videos, you sometimes record not as clear due to camera motion. With accelerating speed, you can correct these errors and remove any missing timestamps. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Disadvantages including:** | Audio distortion                                                                                                                                                                  | When increasing video speed, the audio is affected. To get the original sound, you need to edit it. Or better yet, you can add a new soundtrack, which will you a little more time to edit.                                                            |
| Increased video size         | When accelerating the speed of Instagram video when editing increases the video size, this, in turn, loads very slow when uploading on Instagram.                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
