## Part 4: How to Add Your Own Background Music to Reels?

In case you don't want to use any of the songs from Reel's music section, instead use something of your own; you can do that too! All you will have to do is use any of the music apps on your phone with your Instagram account. Then, play your favorite song, and while doing that, start recording a reel. The music that is being played will be added to the Reel.

## Part 5: How to Add Your Own Voice to Instagram Reels?

If you don't want to add music as your background sound, instead use your voice as a voiceover; Instagram has the voiceover feature that will let you do that. However, you can apply this feature only after finishing your recording.

## Part 7: How to Add Music to Instagram Reels Business Account?

Adding music to a regular Instagram Reels account is easy. You can pick any song that you like and add it as a background sound. However, when it comes to business accounts, there is a restriction.

The key is to search for a song with the words "Original Music."
