Only a couple of years ago, editing the audio of a video clip captured with a Smartphone would require you to transfer the video clip to a computer and then use a video editing software to add music to the video, but in 2018, you can easily add music to the videos you want to post on Instagram by using apps for Android and iPhone devices.
