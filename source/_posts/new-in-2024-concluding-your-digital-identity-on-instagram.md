Instagram is one of the widely used social media platforms around the world with about [1 million](https://backlinko.com/instagram-users) active users every month and a total of 1.074 billion users in 2021\. Most people don’t realize time flying while using Instagram and it can become very addictive.

This problem is sorted out by deactivating or deleting the Instagram account. The difference between deleting an Instagram account and deactivating an Instagram account is that while deleting is permanent, deactivating is temporary.

Let’s have a look at how both these actions can be performed in case you feel like Instagram is impacting your life more than it’s needed.

## Part 1: How to Delete an Instagram Account Permanently

If you are choosing to delete an Instagram account it is important to know that this is a permanent process and you will lose all the data along with your account.

To delete an account:

**Step 1**: [Log in](https://www.instagram.com/) to your Instagram account from your web browser using your credentials

![log-in-instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-log-in-instagram.jpg)

**Step 2**: After logging in, [click here](https://www.instagram.com/accounts/remove/request/permanent/) and you will be diverted to the accounts deleting page of Instagram

**Step 3**: Choose the reason why you wish to delete your Instagram account from the drop-down tab and enter your password for security verification. Then click on Delete (Your account name) tab.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![delete-instagram-account-page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-delete-instagram-account-page.jpg)

Instagram will display a message saying that your account will be erased within a month and until then it will be hidden from the rest of the Instagram users. You will also be notified via your email id if it was added to your account.

## Part 2: How to Deactivate an Instagram Account Temporarily

In case you have a very interesting Instagram account with a lot of followers and posts, and you wish to take a break from Instagram, then deactivating Instagram would be the best option.

Deactivating your account will only temporarily remove your account and you can start where you left off whenever you will. All your data will be preserved till you return.

To deactivate an Instagram account:

**Step 1**: log in to your Instagram account from a browser using your id and password

**Step 2**: Click on the mini display pic on the top right corner and then from the dropdown menu tap on Settings.

![tap-on-instagram-settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-tap-on-instagram-settings.jpg)

**Step 3**: A new window will open where the Edit Profile tab from the left panel will be opened. Towards the bottom of the page, you will find Temporarily disable my account. Tap on it.

![disable-instagram-account](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-disable-instagram-account.jpg)

**Step 4**: On the new page, select the reason why you wish to take a break from the drop-down menu and enter your password. Then click on the Temporarily Disable Account bar.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![delete-instagram-account-temporarily](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-delete-instagram-account-temporarily.jpg)

**Step 5**: A small caution message will be displayed. Tap on Yes and your account will be temporarily removed.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![confirm-deleting-instagram-account](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-confirm-deleting-instagram-account.jpg)

You will receive a notification via mail saying that your Instagram account has been deactivated temporarily.

## Part 3: How to Reactivate an Instagram Account

The benefit of deactivating your Instagram account is that you can return where you left off whenever you wish. All the data will be retrieved once you reactivate your account and you can continue using your Instagram account as before.

To reactivate your deactivated Instagram account:

**Step 1**: Open the Instagram login page on your web browser

**Step 2**: Simply enter your Instagram user name and password, and tap on Log In.

Your account will be reactivated and all your posts, followers, messages can be accessed.
