The privacy of Instagram users is very carefully safeguarded. Facebook's servers store all the images and their digital imprints in highly encrypted form. Therefore, finding the user's profile using a photo is not a convenient method. Contrary to Facebook, where you can find a user's profile by using the unique Image ID of images downloaded from their site. Instagram does not provide such a simplified way to identify who uploaded a picture.

Here are some techniques that can help you locate an Instagram user using Instagram Image Search and Reverse Image Search. However, you can certainly narrow down your search to get more credible results using these methods, despite their inability to identify the exact profile. Various tools and techniques will be discussed in this post for reverse image search Instagram.

## **Why do You need To Perform Instagram Reverse Image Search?**

Two general uses of Instagram image searches are:

* Using an Instagram photo to find a person (a profile);
* When it comes to detecting plagiarism.

So if you want to find your childhood friend, you can find his profile and reconnect if you have his photo. You can check whether your photos have been used on other resources without your permission if you are a photographer and want to protect your pictures on Instagram.

The reasons for this are numerous, but there is just one solution - image search engines are needed. The most powerful ones have been compiled for you so that you can search faster.

## **Performing Reverse Image Search For Instagram**

**We got 4 ways in this article:**

* [Google Image Search](#way1)
* [Social Catfish](#way2)
* [Tineye | Instagram Image Search](#way3)
* [Bing Image Search](#way4)

#### **1\. Google Image Search**

An effective way to determine where a photo came from is through a reverse image search. You can quickly discover similar images to Instagram by using the reverse Instagram image search tool. Your images can be uploaded to the Search Engine, which will display them as if they were drawn from the web.

In 'Search by Image,' you can upload a picture and get all the related photos along with the source. If the URL with the picture is from Instagram, you can find the user and other information about the profile.

![google-image-search-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-image-search-poster.png)

You can perform a Reverse Image Search using Instagram with these simple steps.

1. First of all, go to images.google.com using your mobile, pc, tablet, etc.

![google-image-search-step1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-image-search-step1.png)

1. Along the search bar, you will see a 'Camera Icon'
2. To upload an image, click the icon and choose it from your device's storage

![google-image-search-step3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-image-search-step3.png)

1. When you click on the picture, you will see the results that match it.

#### **2\. Social Catfish**

Locate and verify people's identities with this service. This software is very good: it analyzes an image's resolution, size, location, and other parameters to make the search accurate. However, it has two significant disadvantages - the slow search speed and the high monthly fee ($27). Here's how we act:

 1. Go to the official website of Social Catfish.

![social-catfish-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/social-catfish-poster.png)

1. Click on the image icon.

![social-catfish-image-search-bar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/social-catfish-image-search-bar.png)

#### **3\. Tineye | Instagram Image Search**

With Tineye, you can only search for rev images. The process is similar to above, upload an image, and the site will display all the related images, and these sites will host the images. Only the original location of the image can be found if you are lucky enough. It finds the images by using a proprietary algorithm. An example of such an algorithm is perceptual hashing, which creates a hash based on the sample image.

 1. Open the Tinyeye Homepage.

1. Click on the upload button and select the image from your storage device.
2. Click on the search icon, and you will get the results.

#### **4\. Bing Image Search**

With Bing, you can also search by image for a profile or piece of information. By clicking the camera icon, you can upload the picture to Bing, and all the relevant details will appear if they exist. User names are omitted from the image URLs, so other users cannot discover the images. A deletion notice is automatically sent after each upload.

 1. You can open Bing Image by clicking the lens icon.

The privacy of Instagram users is very carefully safeguarded. Facebook's servers store all the images and their digital imprints in highly encrypted form. Therefore, finding the user's profile using a photo is not a convenient method. Contrary to Facebook, where you can find a user's profile by using the unique Image ID of images downloaded from their site. Instagram does not provide such a simplified way to identify who uploaded a picture.

Here are some techniques that can help you locate an Instagram user using Instagram Image Search and Reverse Image Search. However, you can certainly narrow down your search to get more credible results using these methods, despite their inability to identify the exact profile.

## **Performing Reverse Image Search For Instagram**

**We got 4 ways in this article:**

* [Google Image Search](#way1)
* [Social Catfish](#way2)
* [Tineye | Instagram Image Search](#way3)
* [Bing Image Search](#way4)

#### **1\. Google Image Search**

An effective way to determine where a photo came from is through a reverse image search. You can quickly discover similar images to Instagram by using the reverse Instagram image search tool. Your images can be uploaded to the Search Engine, which will display them as if they were drawn from the web.

In 'Search by Image,' you can upload a picture and get all the related photos along with the source. If the URL with the picture is from Instagram, you can find the user and other information about the profile.

1. When you click on the picture, you will see the results that match it.

#### **2\. Social Catfish**

Locate and verify people's identities with this service. This software is very good: it analyzes an image's resolution, size, location, and other parameters to make the search accurate. However, it has two significant disadvantages - the slow search speed and the high monthly fee ($27). Here's how we act:

 1. Go to the official website of Social Catfish.

![social-catfish-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/social-catfish-poster.png)

![social-catfish-image-icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/social-catfish-image-icon.png)

#### **3\. Tineye | Instagram Image Search**

With Tineye, you can only search for rev images. The process is similar to above, upload an image, and the site will display all the related images, and these sites will host the images. Only the original location of the image can be found if you are lucky enough. It finds the images by using a proprietary algorithm. An example of such an algorithm is perceptual hashing, which creates a hash based on the sample image.

 1. Open the Tinyeye Homepage.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![tineye-instagram-image-search](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tineye-instagram-image-search.png)

1. Click on the upload button and select the image from your storage device.
2. Click on the search icon, and you will get the results.

#### **4\. Bing Image Search**

With Bing, you can also search by image for a profile or piece of information. By clicking the camera icon, you can upload the picture to Bing, and all the relevant details will appear if they exist. User names are omitted from the image URLs, so other users cannot discover the images. A deletion notice is automatically sent after each upload.

 1. You can open Bing Image by clicking the lens icon.

![bing-image-search-step1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bing-image-search-step1.png)

1. To get results, either paste a URL, take a picture, or upload a picture.

![bing-image-search-step2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bing-image-search-step2.png)

1. There is a good categorization of the results into text on the Photo, Web Pages with the images, and All Resolution Images. There is a copy option included in the results when the image consists of text.
