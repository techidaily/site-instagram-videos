### Combination of short & long

It would be best if you used short and long hashtags together to match the context of your podcast. For example, your podcast is on fitness. Your short hashtags will cover general topics like; health and healthy life. While longer hashtags would be more precise. For example: the right diet plan, workout routine plan, exercises, etc.

### Connect your target audience

Your target audience plays a vital role. Thus it's crucial to know how your target audience would search for your podcast. Knowing your audience better will make you choose the right hashtags. That will keep your audience growing.

### Keep updating

It is imperative to relate to the current trends of the podcast. This means you should keep updating your hashtags often with the changing trends. Avoid using tags that no longer match the podcast industry trends. Before uploading a new podcast that fits the trend, you need to know about the new hashtags.
