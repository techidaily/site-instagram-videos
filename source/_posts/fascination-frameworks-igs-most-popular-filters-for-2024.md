## Part 1: What Are Instagram Filters?

An Instagram filter lets you edit your picture before and after capturing it. With a wide range of filters, one can just click and get an absolutely different background, frame, saturation, brightness, sharpness, and resolution.

Also known as the Augmented Reality (AR) filter, the effect is placed over the picture and videos to give it a pleasant and vibrant look. There are several reasons associated with the use of Instagram video filters. You can advertise your product or brand by inserting the logo. In this way, the brand is approached by millions of people around the world.

The use of the correct filter is important in marketing as well. Therefore, playing with Instagram presets has to be careful. There are some funny and interesting filters that can be incorporated in pictures and videos to give it an amusing look. However, keep few things in your mind.

For starters, do not over filter your photo. It may give an altogether new vibe to it but also leads to a fake and artificial result. Moreover, you might want to keep the same filter for your brand. It will keep your audience and customers away from mixed messages.
