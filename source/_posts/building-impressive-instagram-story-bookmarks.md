Instagram highlight covers or Instagram Story covers are little circles right below your IG profile bio. They are a great way to categorize and eternalize your stories on the feed for your audience to enjoy repeatedly. **Creating Instagram highlight covers** is a great way to build your brand and make your profile stand out. Moreover, you can customize your highlight covers with patterns, colors, and graphics to add to the overall aesthetic. However, the question is, how to make Instagram highlight covers?

No worries, here in this article, we will walk you through each step on how to create Instagram highlight covers.

## Part 1: Instagram Highlight Cover Size and Dimensions

The highlight covers are small. Thus, it is vital to have the correct size and dimensions. Creating highlight covers with proper width and height ensures that you do not have to crop any of your designs.

Generally, the Instagram highlight covers dimensions are the same as Insta stories, that is, 1080 pixels by 1920 pixels or a 9:16 aspect ratio. We recommend using square 1:1 dimensions when designing your custom highlight covers with high pixels as they work well.

![Filmora Instagram highlight ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-instagram-highlight.jpg)

When designing custom highlight covers on Canva, you will notice that the icon will be in the middle of a story-size rectangle. The overall aspect ratio to make highlight covers in Canva is 9:16\. However, ensure that that the illustration is centered when you add it as your Instagram highlight icon.

## Part 2: How to Make Instagram Highlight Cover on Canva?

Instagram allows you to use just about any image you like for your highlight covers. However, if you want your brand to stand out among the competition, you must get past just any image. Highlight covers are a prime space to attract visitors, turn them into customers, and leave a lasting impression. So, make the best use of it by creating custom highlight covers.

There are many photo editors you can use for Instagram highlight cover and creating great-looking Instagram highlight covers is super easy with the free online tool Canva.
