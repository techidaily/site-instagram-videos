Instagram is one of the widely used social media platforms around the world with about [1 million](https://backlinko.com/instagram-users) active users every month and a total of 1.074 billion users in 2021\. Most people don’t realize time flying while using Instagram and it can become very addictive.

This problem is sorted out by deactivating or deleting the Instagram account. The difference between deleting an Instagram account and deactivating an Instagram account is that while deleting is permanent, deactivating is temporary.
