## Part 5: Benefits of Linking Your Account to Facebook

Social media is a big thing in this era, and it only continues to grow. If you take advantage of the growing social media power, you will gain financial and social benefits. However, it is not that easy to be visible on social media. Linking your Facebook to Instagram can save your time and effort to build a presence. Here are some advantages of it:

### 1\. **Brand identity**

By connecting your Facebook and Instagram, you can be more visible and build your brand identity, especially if you are a business. People who buy from you through both platforms gain a sense of trust when the account is linked.

### 2\. **Post on both platforms simultaneously**

You do not have to go on Instagram and Facebook separately to make a post. You can post a picture on Instagram, and it will post directly on Facebook when the accounts are synced; it saves a lot of time and effort.

### 3\. **Compare audience**

When both platforms are synced together, you can better analyze how the audience reacts to your posts. You can change your content to make it more engaging and valuable for your audience. The growth on both platforms is also almost the same, which benefits you.

### 4\. **Pay for ads in one place**

Facebook and Instagram ads are a few sources through which pages, bloggers, and brands gain an audience. Linking your accounts can make you run better ads that can help attract more audiences. Also, you can pay for ads on both platforms in a unified place.

**Conclusion:**

If you are a business on Instagram or a blogger, it would be advantageous to learn how to connect Instagram to Facebook. With so much competition today on digital platforms, posting consistent content for fast growth is wise. Rather than posting content on Facebook and Instagram separately, you can automatically post the same content on both platforms by connecting them. It helps in increasing visibility and saves time. We have explained how to connect Instagram to the Facebook account, Facebook page and unlink both social media for your ease. So, go ahead and start growing your brand.
