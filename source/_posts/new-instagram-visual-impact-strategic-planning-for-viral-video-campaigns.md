## Part 1: You Need To Understand IG First

If you market a product without knowing the culture, tastes, or likes of the people around, you are most likely to fail. So, while marketing a product on Instagram, you must know and understand the culture followed at Instagram.

For instance, when the brand [Pepsi selected China to expand](https://www.daytranslations.com/blog/how-pepsi-expands/), the launch slogan was “Pepsi Brings You Back to Life” which was misinterpreted by the people as “Pepsi Brings Your Ancestors Back from the Grave”. This was a huge mistake for the brand when it was trying to make a mark on the global level.

So, prior to planning strategies for Instagram video marketing, you must be aware of the type of promotions and marketing you should plan so that you never go wrong with your strategies. You must know the audience and understand their choices, likes, and what can drive them to your video.

## Part 2: How to Plan Your Instagram Video Marketing

To ensure a successful Instagram video marketing strategy, it is important that your videos are not just moving pieces without any message to convey. There has to be some [key objective for your Instagram video](https://animoto.com/blog/business/video-marketing-objectives).

However, every video may not have a thoughtful or reflective objective because product launches or major announcements and not done each and every week. Whatever the objective of your video is, the moving images must tell a story that the audiences can accept and turn to again and again.

The primary objective of the video must be to come across clearly without confusing the viewers.

It is quite possible that your Instagram video marketing content is for introducing a new product. The product can be in a number of colors or have a lot of features. But, that doesn’t mean you have to include it all in a 60-second video. Only add a few features and make the objective of the video clear for the audience to feel connected.

You may also create several short videos to make the audience understand it easily instead of one long video.

The primary objective of the video must be to come across clearly without confusing the viewers.

It is quite possible that your Instagram video marketing content is for introducing a new product. The product can be in a number of colors or have a lot of features. But, that doesn’t mean you have to include it all in a 60-second video. Only add a few features and make the objective of the video clear for the audience to feel connected.
