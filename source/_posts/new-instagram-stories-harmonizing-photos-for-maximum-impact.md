If you are okay with the editing and happy with the final look, it's now time to gets it published by clicking on the "Next" button present on the bottom of the screen. Your story is now live, that would last for 24 hours.

Congratulations, the task is now over, and this is how to put multiple pictures on Instagram story.

There is another way to put more than one picture on the Instagram story and here are the steps of a photo sticker feature.

**Step 1**: Log into your Instagram account.

**Step 2**: Take a fresh shot with the camera icon or just upload the images from the camera roll using the "+" symbol.

**Step 3**: Select the photo sticker option.

**Step 4**: Now, add more photos to your Instagram story with the "image select" option. Such action results in many photos on a single Instagram story like a collage.

**Note**: The photo sticker may not be available in everyone's account.
