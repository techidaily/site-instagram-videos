### #1\. Why Instagram launched Reels? Copy TikTok?

As a competitor to various apps, Instagram has adapted to the latest trends pretty quickly.

The few differences are that Instagram provides many other features as well but on the other hand time limit on TikTok is up to 1 minute. Furthermore, Reels disappear after 24 hours, where TikTok videos don’t.
