We are living in an age of social media, and the intensive sharing of photos, which millions can see, is commonplace on a daily level. No doubt, one of the most popular social platforms around the world is Instagram, with the exciting option - IG Story. With this feature, posted photos and short videos disappear after 24 hours.
