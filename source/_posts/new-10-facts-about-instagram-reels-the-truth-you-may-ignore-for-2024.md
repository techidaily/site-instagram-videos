Tired of switching between various apps? Don't you worry anymore; Instagram has got it all! Over the years, Instagram has introduced many new features and has become a one-stop-shop for social media users.

Instagram initially started with the option of only uploading pictures in 2010\. Two years later, in 2012, Mark Zuckerberg bought Instagram, and since then, it has been a competitor to many apps. Introducing the chat feature, stories, IGTV, and its most recent update of the Instagram Reels, Instagram continues to seize the market. It is now the sixth most popular social media platform with more than one billion active users.

Here, in this article, we will familiarize you with how to make and create reels on Instagram and 10 interesting facts about the latest update.

### #1\. Why Instagram launched Reels? Copy TikTok?

The few differences are that Instagram provides many other features as well but on the other hand time limit on TikTok is up to 1 minute. Furthermore, Reels disappear after 24 hours, where TikTok videos don’t.
