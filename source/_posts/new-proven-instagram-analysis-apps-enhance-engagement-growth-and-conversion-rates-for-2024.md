#### 3\. [Instagram Insights](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1533933820244654)

Besides providing the insights into the metrics of your Instagram posts and stories, Instagram Insights also allows you to see how well your ads on Instagram are doing. You can only access this Instagram analytics tool from your phone, and you won't be able to keep track of posts you shared before you converted to a Facebook Business profile.

#### 4\. [Owlmetrics](https://owlmetrics.com/)

 A quick look at the list of features Owlmetrics provides is enough to explain why this Instagram analytics tool is regarded as one of the most advanced tools on the market. Measuring the audience growth, keeping track of the users who stopped following your Instagram profile or knowing how much traffic the links in your Bio are driving are only a few commodities you'll be able to enjoy if you choose to utilize this analytics tool. Tracking and analyzing hashtags that generate the best response from the audience is easy with Owlmetrics.

#### 7\. [Sprout Social](https://sproutsocial.com/)

 Sprout Social combines analytics tools with the tools you can use to schedule posts on several different social media platforms, including Instagram. It is probably not best suited for small marketing teams because its features were designed to improve the workflow of large companies and teams that need to manage large databases. Its price suggests the same, since the cheapest version of Sprout Social you can get costs $99, while the most expensive option for enterprises costs $249.
