## Facebook and Instagram specs

 Before knowing how to make a video meme for Instagram/Facebook, how about understanding their specs on both the platforms and get the best out of it? It is of utmost importance to know the social media specs before venturing into video marketing in these platforms.

### Facebook

 Videos on Facebook are virally consumed every year at a large scale. This is the reason online marketers emphasize more on the right Facebook video specs. On an [average 45% users at least consume one hour of video per week over Facebook or YouTube](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2017/03/08/video-marketing-statistics). The real challenge for business owners is, deciding the right type of videos to post! Depending the video format, the specs and dimensions differ which might confuse you.

| |  Video resolution | Minimum width           | Aspect ratio | Max video size | Recommended video formats |         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------- | ------- |
| Facebook            | 1280x720                | 600 pixels   | 16:9/9:16      | 4GB                       | MP4/MOV |
| Instagram           | 600x315/600x600/600x750 | /            | 1.91:1/1:1/4:5 | 4GB                       | MP4/MOV |

 Here is a quick guide –

 Shared posts are the most common video types that stay on your Facebook feed which others can share. Though, it’s tough to get organic reach on Facebook. It’s one of the most effective methods for sharing videos. There are 2 popular video orientations ‘Landscape’ and ‘Portrait’ for that matter.

* Landscape and portrait videos need to be of 1280X720.
* The width should at least be 600 pixels.
* Aspect ratio for landscape is 16:9 and portrait is 9:16 (16:9 when video has a link).
* On mobile both the video types aspect ratio remains 2:3.
* The recommended formats are .MP4 and .MOV with 4GB maximum file size limit.
* Video should have 30fps max frames and length needs to be 120 minutes at max.
* Maximum word count is 2,200 characters but 90 characters is recommended for links.
* Link description is 30 characters max with 25 characters long headline.

### Instagram

 When it comes to Instagram, it has [71% of brands with it that reach to their audience](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/instagram-stats/). Due to the high visibility rate over the internet, brand-created Instagram videos are worth investing. It has three different video formats, such as landscape, vertical, and square. Mobile being an indispensable device nowadays, accessing social networking platforms has grown tremendously. This in turn made Instagram videos a big hit, though, organic reach is comparatively less.

* The minimum resolution for videos in landscape, vertical, and square is 600X315, 600X750, and 600X600 respectively.
* Likewise, the aspect ratios for landscape, vertical, and square is 1.91:1, 1:1, and 4:5 respectively.
* The video formats, maximum file size and maximum frames are same as Facebook videos. Though, the video size is only 60 seconds.
* Maximum caption and recommended are 2,200 and 125 characters respectively.
