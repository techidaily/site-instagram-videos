**Step 4**: To add borders to the video for Instagram, select the **Effect** tab present on the horizontal menu.

## Part 3: How to Add Border to Video for Instagram Online?

In this part of the guide, we will look at three methods and guide you on how to add border to video for Instagram online using Kapwing, Canva

### 1\. Kapwing

It's a free online application for editing photos, movies, and GIFs. It does not need registration, so you may begin editing instantly and securely. You have a 250 MB upload limit and may export videos up to 7 minutes in length. Here's your step-by-step guide to **add border to video for Instagram** using Kapwing:

**Step 1**: Select the Start editing on Kapwing's website. It will lead you to the video file upload screen, where you may drag and drop the file or **Click to upload**.

![add video image kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-video-image-kapwing.jpg)

**Step 2**: Here I will upload a 9:16 aspect ratio video to Kapwing as an example. Kapwing allows you to zoom out the video to make it smaller to make a border around the video. Besides, you can also drag the corners of the video to resize to get the borders.

![kapwing add borders to video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-out-video-add-frame.jpg)

**Step 3**: When you're happy with the results, go to the top and select **Export Video** to save the video to your computer.

### 2\. Canva

Canva is a must-have software for anybody who modifies both pictures and videos. It may be accessed from both a smartphone and a computer. Furthermore, the free edition has all of the functionality you'll ever require. Here's your step-by-step guide to add border to video for Instagram using Canva:

**Step 1:** Try downloading and _launching_ the **Canva app**, or use the web browser to access it. Then go to **Social media** and pick your preferred film aspect ratio. Here I will choose Instagram Post.

![create instagram story video on canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-instagram-story-canva.jpg)

**Step 2:** Then upload the video to **Canva** to modify it and apply a border. To do so, go to the left pane and choose **Upload media** from the **Uploads** menu. Now navigate to the video's location and post it.

![upload media to canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-media-canva.jpg)

**Step 3:** The clip will appear under the **Videos** section in the **Uploads** category. To view the clip in the editing window, click on it. You may move the video around by dragging it.
