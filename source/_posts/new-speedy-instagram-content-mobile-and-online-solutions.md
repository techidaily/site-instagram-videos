## Part 1: How to Speed up Video for Instagram on iPhone with Hyperlapse?

When speeding up Instagram videos, Hyperlapse is unquestionably the most acceptable option for iPhone users. A supplementary app (Hyperlapse) for Instagram is specifically developed to allow users to accelerate Instagram video speed.

![hyperlapse from instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hyperlapse-from-instagram.jpg)

You have the option of uploading a video from your iPhone or shooting a movie from inside the application. By default, your video is being played at a speed of 6X. This software, however, also has several drawbacks. For example, it can only assist you in increasing the pace of the videos. There are no editing features.

To know how to speed up a video for Instagram using Hyperlapse, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Launch Hyperlapse on your iPhone, press the **record** button. Stop filming anytime you wish and keep your hands motionless.

**Step 2:** You'll see a speedometer now. The default speed is **6X**, but you may lower it to **1X** or boost it to **12X** if you choose. Move to the right to speed up the video.

**Step 3:** Right after you've chosen your desired speed, click "OK." If you want to share the video, you may do so on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook.
