## Part 1: How to Use Green Screen Effects in IG

**Instagram green screen** is one of the most talked-about things about Instagram since last year. It enables a Hollywood-style effect for backgrounds while you're sitting at your home. You can now virtually travel to different destinations by using the green screen effect. You can also import other stickers and classic posters in your background with the help of the green-screen product.

The green background can be replaced with various sceneries or any kind of background imaginable. Now, if you want to make a snap or an Instagram video at an adventurous destination, you don't have to go there. You can do it by using a virtual background with the help of the Instagram green-screen effect.

If you have not heard of the green screen effect of Instagram yet, then don't worry. This is the perfect time to know how to use this effect on Instagram, and for this, we have got you covered. In this part, we will discuss a stepwise method to use the green screen Instagram effect. So, let's get started:

### Step1: Launch Instagram

First things first, launch the Instagram app on your phone to get started. Now click on the little **\+** icon on your profile picture to start an Instagram story.

## Part 2: How to Use the Green Screen on Instagram Reel

Instagram has launched the Instagram Reel, and since then, people are going crazy about it. But it being a new feature, not much of it is known about. Instagram has added several new features to the Reels function that lets the user capture his videos and upload them right away using the Instagram app. One of the prime features is the **Green Screen Instagram** effect.

The green screen feature on Instagram Reels allows you to add virtual background to your videos and images. You could be sitting in your room, but it can make it look like you're somewhere vacationing. It allows you to import your media as your background. You can also use filters as your background to make it more entertaining.

Several creators have uploaded their green screen filters for Instagram Reels. Moreover, Instagram has also officially made a green screen effect for its users. But you need to know how to use the green screen on Instagram Reel before you get started with it. The following steps can assist you in that:

### Step 1: Launch the app

### Step 3: Select Reels

Now select the **Reels** option. A panel will appear on the right side, and then you need to choose **Effects** from it. Remember that the green screen effect is not already provided, so you have to search for it. Swipe all the way to the right until you get to the **Browse Effects** option.

### Step 4: Search Green Screen

Now, search **Green Screen** in the search menu and click the first option to see the official green screen ig effect. Now **download** the effect using the download the option.

## Part 3: How to Remove Background from Instagram Video without Green Effect Effects

Instagram has updated the app to support a longer video form named IGTV for content creators. Thanks to IGTV, it supports videos longer than 60 seconds on the main feed. IGTV only supports limited dimensional video, i.e., 4:5 a minimum and 9:16 maximum ratio.

However, Instagram also supports landscape videos, portrait videos, and square videos. Being a content creator, you need a good video editor to edit and remove the background of your Instagram videos. Well, we will recommend [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to edit your Instagram videos. It has the following benefits for editing an IGTV video via Filmora:

* You can customize your video or portrait to any ratio besides the common ratios. This can be done by opening **File-project Settings** and entering the ratio you want to customize your project.
* It supports several video audio formats and allows you to alter the frame rate, video speed, etc. You can upload the video on Instagram directly and many other social media websites once you are done editing.
* It also has built-in filters that are specially designed for IGTV videos. It also has numerous special effects for you to make your video look professional.
* You can even customize the video and add catchy text and subtitles to make it more engaging.
* The final video can be directly exported to social media platforms.

**Al Portrait in Filmora** is the best way to remove the background of an Instagram video without Green Screen Instagram effects. It can remove the background of IGTV video without affecting its movement and lighting. The following steps can assist you in knowing how to use it for removing the background.

### Step 1: Import Media

Import the media you want to upload on Instagram to Filmora. Then select **AI Portrait** from **Effects** in the menu.

![add media to Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-media-remove-video-bg.jpg)

### Step 2: Add the AI Portrait Effect to Remove Video Background

Al Portrait is not a free module, so either you have to **Purchase** it or **Try it for free**. There are various assets under AI Portrait, to remove the video background and isolate the human, you need to add Human Segmentation to the timeline. **Play the video** once to check the segmentation of the effects that you have applied to your video.

![add human segmentation effects in  Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-human-segmentation-to-remove-background.jpg)

### Step 3: Adjust Effects

Different effects have different settings so that you can adjust the effects according to your convenience. You have to **double click** the video in the timeline and then go to the Video Effects to adjust the **Percentage, Edge thickness, Edge Feature, and Alpha** setting of the effect. You can also restore the changes you've made by selecting the **Restore** button.

![add human segmentation effects ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/human-segmentation-effects-adjust.jpg)

Now you have gotten a video without a background, you can now add your own background to compose them together.

![compose green screen video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/compose-video-without-green-screen.jpg)

### Step 4: Export the video
