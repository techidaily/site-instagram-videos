**#1\. Establish a Strong Social Media Presence**

![establish a strong social media presence](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-01.jpg)

To establish a solid social media presence, you need to make sure you're posting regularly. That means posting interesting, engaging content that will get people talking.

But it's not just about quantity – it's also about quality. Make sure your posts are well-written and offer something unique or insightful that will add value to your followers' lives. If you can do all of that, you'll be on your way to social media success.

**#2\. Optimize Your Profile**

![optimize your profile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-02.jpg)

Ensure your Instagram profile is complete, including a catchy bio and profile photo. Fill out all of the necessary information in the "Contact" section so that users can easily reach out to you.

**#3\. Know your audience**

![know your audience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-03.jpg)

There’s no point in creating a great Instagram account if you don’t know who your target audience is, what they like and dislike, what they are interested in, and what they aren’t interested in. You need to know as much about them as possible before you start growing your following because this will help you create content that appeals to them.

**#4\. Post at the right time of day**

![post at the right time of day](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-04.jpg)

As with most social media platforms, there are best times to post on Instagram. These vary depending on your audience, but the best time to post is between 9 am and 11 am EST (12 pm-2 pm GMT), 1 pm and 3 pm EST (4 pm-6 pm GMT) or between 6:30 pm and 8:30 pm EST (8:30 am – 10:30 am GMT).

There's no exact science behind this; it's just what has worked best in my experience as well as that of other Instagram marketing pros I've spoken with. The key is consistency—posting at different times makes you appear more human than if you were posting at exactly the same time every day—but not too much so that users get annoyed by how often they see new posts from you each day!

**#5\. Use Hashtags to Reach a Wider Audience**

![use hashtags to reach a wider audience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-05.jpg)

Using relevant hashtags is a great way to make your content more visible and accessible to people looking for what you have to offer. Hashtags can help you connect with like-minded people and grow your online community.

So, start using hashtags today and see the difference it makes to your content strategy!

**#6\. Engage with Other Users**

![engage with other users](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-06.jpg)

You can't just rely on others to come to you – go out and engage with them! Like and comment on other Instagrammers' posts, follow them and participate in Instagram challenges or Instagram pods (groups of Instagrammers who support each other by liking and commenting on each other's content).

**#7\. Post-User-Generated Content**

![post-user-generated content](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-07.jpg)

Encourage your followers to tag you in their Instagram posts featuring your product or brand. This not only gets more eyes on your profile but also builds trust and customer loyalty. And don't forget to thank them for the shoutout!

**#8\. Collaborate with Influencers**

![collaborate with influencers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-08.jpg)

Partnering with Instagram influencers in your industry can introduce you to their large following and vice versa. This can result in a significant boost in your Instagram followers.

**#9\. Share Your Instagram Profile on Other Platforms**

![share your instagram profile on other platforms](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-09.jpg)

Don't forget to promote your Instagram on other social media platforms and your website or blog. Put the link in your bio and include it in any relevant posts or newsletters.

**#10\. Take Advantage of Instagram Stories**

![take advantage of instagram stories](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-10.jpg)

Instagram stories have become increasingly popular and offer a fun way for users to interact with your brand or business. Use them to showcase behind-the-scenes content, exclusive offers, or Q&As with followers. And don't forget to add relevant Instagram story hashtags or location tags to increase visibility.

**#11\. Tag Brands in Your Posts**

![tag brands in your post](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-11.jpg)

If using products from a specific brand, don't forget to tag them in your Instagram posts. This not only helps increase visibility for both parties, but it can also result in potential collaborations.

**#12\. Follow the Right People**

![follow the right people](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-12.jpg)

Follow Instagrammers in the same industry as you who post content relevant to your brand or business. This can help drive more traffic to your profile and potentially result in new followers.

## Takeaway

The takeaway from this article is to understand how to use the Instagram algorithm and how it works. So, what are the main points you should take away from this?

* The Instagram algorithm is an important concept for all brands to understand. It's going to help you make better content and improve your engagement.
* Use hashtags sparingly to avoid getting shadow banned by Instagram. Make sure that your hashtags are relevant, but don't go overboard, as it will annoy users who might be searching for those terms.
* Engagement with other users on Instagram can help grow your account much faster than simply posting pictures or videos of products alone since other users will see them in their feeds and potentially interact with them via likes, comments, or even following your account if they find it interesting enough!

## Conclusion

If you consistently gain 1,000 followers on Instagram every month, your account will grow significantly in terms of followers. As more people interact with your content, you'll also see a rise in engagement.

So, start using the tips mentioned above and see the difference it makes to your Instagram following!
