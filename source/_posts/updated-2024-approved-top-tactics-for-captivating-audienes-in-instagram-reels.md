## Part 2: How Instagram Reels works?

Instagram reels are your way to the above and beyond. Owing to their video length, Instagram reels tend to be highly effective.

And if you want to keep your videos private, you can choose to upload them only to your feed.

## Part 3: How to Use Instagram Reels

Creating Instagram reels as easy as the other features on this app. Follow our step-by-step tutorial and let your creativity guide you through the rest.

1.You can open Instagram reels in one of the 3 ways. Firstly, click on the **Stories** camera tab, and on the bottom, swipe to click on **Reels**. Secondly, tap on the **plus** **sign** on the home screen. Or, go to the **Reels** tab and click on the **camera** **icon** in the top right corner.

## Part 4: Instagram Reels VS TikTok

Much like TikTok, Instagram reels are reserved for creating short and engaging videos. Instagram reels can be browsed from the Explore tab. And similarly, TikTok videos can be browsed from the For You tab. One major similarity between these two is the editing feature. There are various tools in both TikTok and Instagram reels that enable users to make their videos unique and entertaining.

Instagram reels are said to be inspired by TikTok but it has many differences that set it apart. Such as the video clip length for Instagram reels is reserved to 15 seconds, whereas TikTok videos can be up to 1 minute long. The biggest difference is that TikTok is an app dedicated to short videos and Instagram reels is a feature inside the parent Instagram app. TikTok allows the option of creating duets, but Instagram reels lack this option limiting user creativity. Even though both Instagram reels and TikTok have the option to add audio, Instagram reels don't allow the addition of an original song. On the other hand, local music files can be easily uploaded for use on TikTok. Videos on TikTok do not disappear. However, Instagram reels uploaded as stories vanish after 24 hours and are not saved anywhere.

## Part 1: What is Instagram Reels

With the rising popularity of short videos on various platforms, especially TikTok, Instagram innovatively upgraded their app to include a creative feature. Much like TikTok, Instagram reels are the latest feature introduced in august 2020\. Instagram reels allow users to create maximum 15 second videos and then edit to add music, special effects, or stickers.

Instagram reels were introduced with the aim of providing an engaging platform dedicated to short videos. The separate reels tab lets users explore Instagram reels uploaded by other people or brands. The popular Instagram reels are also featured on the Explore tab.

Since video marketing is the new normal now, Instagram reels serve as the perfectly unique way to showcase products and services in eye-catching ways. The various editing features enable users to add stunning effects and popular songs to their videos. So, Instagram reels are great for upscaling your marketing without much effort.

Instagram reels also work as highlights or insight into an event or product you are launching or using.

## Part 4: Instagram Reels VS TikTok

Much like TikTok, Instagram reels are reserved for creating short and engaging videos. Instagram reels can be browsed from the Explore tab. And similarly, TikTok videos can be browsed from the For You tab. One major similarity between these two is the editing feature. There are various tools in both TikTok and Instagram reels that enable users to make their videos unique and entertaining.

Instagram reels are said to be inspired by TikTok but it has many differences that set it apart. Such as the video clip length for Instagram reels is reserved to 15 seconds, whereas TikTok videos can be up to 1 minute long. The biggest difference is that TikTok is an app dedicated to short videos and Instagram reels is a feature inside the parent Instagram app. TikTok allows the option of creating duets, but Instagram reels lack this option limiting user creativity. Even though both Instagram reels and TikTok have the option to add audio, Instagram reels don't allow the addition of an original song. On the other hand, local music files can be easily uploaded for use on TikTok. Videos on TikTok do not disappear. However, Instagram reels uploaded as stories vanish after 24 hours and are not saved anywhere.
