You no longer have to be a trained professional to capture videos, all you need is a Smartphone, a GoPro or a DSLR camera. While posting videos you recorded with your phone to Instagram is easy, clips captured with other kinds of cameras must be exported to a computer and properly edited with a video editing software. However, the web version of Instagram that allows you to upload photos and videos doesn't exist, but luckily there are platforms that can help you post photos and videos to Instagram directly from your desktop.
