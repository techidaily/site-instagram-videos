### Several Reasons Why You Shouldn't Watermark Your Instagram Photos

**Watermarks mess up the composition of your shot:** A good photographer is always concerned with the composition of a photo because finding the right balance between all of the visual elements within a frame is as hard as it sounds. A watermark can easily ruin that balance without a good reason since it will hardly prevent someone who decided to steal your work from actually doing it.

**Watermarks are easily removed:** Don't think for a second that anyone with only a basic level of Photoshop skills, can't crop or clone stamp a watermark from a photo. Unless you intend to place a watermark over an entire image, like stock photography websites do, but even then removing a watermark is far from impossible.

**You won't look like a pro:** A watermark will not make you look more professional than you already are, the quality of your photos will. Although photographers sign their prints all the time, a watermark can make you look bad in the eyes of the Instagram's community because you'll look like you think that your work is so good that everyone is going to try to steal it. Be humble, there are other ways of proving that you own the copyrights to a photo, like keeping the RAW file safely stored on your computer's hard-drive or including the copyright information in the photo's metadata.

**Your photos will look like they've been edited:** With all the photo effects Instagram offers and all the photo editing options that are available to photographers, straight-out-of-camera pictures will earn you much more respect from the community on Instagram, than photos that are clearly edited. A watermark can often make people think that the picture has been edited since the photographer took the time to design and add a watermark to a photo.

**Adding watermarks will not make you famous:** At first, it may seem like a good idea to use watermarks for the promotion of your business, but most Instagram users don't really read the names on the watermarks. Strive to produce photos that will make the viewers want to know everything there is to know about you because the quality of your photos is the best advertisement you can get.

## Watermarking Instagram Photos - Tips

If, despite all this, you would still like to add a watermark to your Instagram photos, here are a few tips that will help you avoid making mistakes that can be harmful to the success of your images on Instagram.

**Use monochrome watermarks:** Tastefully designed watermarks, that don't feature too many colors, will serve its purpose, and they will not distract the viewer of a photo too much. A minimalistic approach to watermark design is probably the best, less is more, so use fewer colors in order to achieve better results.

**Place the watermarks around the edges of a photo:** As we already mentioned, adding new visual elements to photos creates all sorts of problems, but if you really want to watermark your photos, at least try to place them on the edges of a photo where they won't attract too much attention.

**Vertically oriented watermarks create less distraction:** This is a great way to distract the viewer as little as possible while keeping the watermark on your photo clearly visible and readable. If you place a vertically oriented watermark near the edge of a photo, the spectator has a better chance of seeing a photo, before realizing that it has a watermark.

**Carefully choose the font and its size:** Use simple fonts. There is no reason to utilize kitschy fonts that are not easily readable because it isn't likely that the viewer of a photo is going to spend time on figuring out what the watermark says. Don't let the watermark become the first thing your Instagram followers see on a photo because they will most probably just keep scrolling without spending a second to figure out what your photo really is about.
