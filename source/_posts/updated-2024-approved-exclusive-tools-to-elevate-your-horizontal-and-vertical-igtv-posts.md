Raw footage almost always contains redundant parts that reduce its overall quality, and in most cases, the content you share on your **IGTV channel** is going to look much better if you take the time to edit it. You don’t really have to be experienced in video editing in order to learn how to use Android and iOS video editing apps since the majority of them are incredibly easy to use. However, finding an app that offers all the video editing tools you’re going to need to create an IGTV video can be difficult, because there are so many different choices you can make. So in this article, we are going to take you through some of the **best video editing apps for iPhone and Android** devices and help you discover the one that best suits your needs.

## 10 Best Video Editing Apps to edit IGTV video for iOS and Android

You have to go through the list of IGTV’s technical specifications, before you start editing your video, in order to know the maximum duration of a video you can share on IGTV or the maximum size of a video file you can share on your IGTV channel. Okay, let's have a look at the ten best video editing apps you can use to edit the videos you upload to IGTV.

#### 1. [iMovie](https://apps.apple.com/qa/app/imovie/id377298193)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS

Die-hard fans of Apple’s products can edit their videos with iMovie, not only on their iPhone but on iPad and iPod as well. There are 8 themes you can choose from that also contain preset transitions and titles, so you just have to add your footage and let iMovie do the rest for you. Moreover, the app offers slow-motion, split-screen, and PIP features as well as ten video filters so you can easily overlay two video clips or enhance the colors in a video. You can also record voiceovers, import songs from your music library, or add sound effects to the audio files you use in your projects.

#### 2. [Quik](https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/quik-app-video-photo-editor)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android

Besides video files you can also add up to 75 photos to the IGTV videos you create with the Quik app. The app is perfectly optimized for processing the footage captured with GoPro cameras, but that doesn’t mean you can’t use it to edit videos captured with other devices. There are 23 themes with graphics and transitions you can use to quickly create a video and you can customize each theme by adjusting the fonts, graphics, and filters. The app lets you change the aspect ratio quickly, so you just have to select the portrait option, in order to make your video perfectly suited for IGTV. You can see how the YouTubers such as Jake Rich edit videos on iPhone with GoPro Quik from the video above.

#### 3. [Videoshop](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/videoshop-video-editor/id615563599?mt=8)

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS, [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.videoshop.app&hl=en)

![Edit Vertical Video on Phones for IGTV ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videoshop-android.JPG)

The long list of features provided by this cross-platform app will impress even the most demanding IGTV video creators. Videoshop lets you merge several clips into a single file, add text to videos, apply a transition between video clips, or even create animated opening titles. Furthermore, you can easily resize a video and create vertically oriented videos for the IGTV platform. You just have to keep in mind that working with a large number of video files can be overwhelming for your phone’s processing power, so it is better to work with fewer video clips if you don’t want the app to crash while you are editing your next IGTV post.

#### 4. [VSCO](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vsco.cam&hl=en)

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vsco/id588013838?mt=8), Android

Even though the VSCO app is primarily associated with photography, you can also use it to capture and edit moving images. The video editing tools are still not available in the free version of the app, and you have to purchase the annual VSCO membership in order to gain access to them. If you decide to become a member of the VSCO community, you will be able to manipulate your footage in virtually any way you want and export it in resolutions that go up to 4K. The rich selection of presets, and visual effects that simulate the visual style of the old film make this digital darkroom an excellent option for IGTV content creators.

#### 5. [Filmora GO](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6)
