**Step 2**: Here I will upload a 9:16 aspect ratio video to Kapwing as an example. Kapwing allows you to zoom out the video to make it smaller to make a border around the video. Besides, you can also drag the corners of the video to resize to get the borders.

### 2\. Canva

Canva is a must-have software for anybody who modifies both pictures and videos. It may be accessed from both a smartphone and a computer. Furthermore, the free edition has all of the functionality you'll ever require. Here's your step-by-step guide to add border to video for Instagram using Canva:

**Step 1:** Try downloading and _launching_ the **Canva app**, or use the web browser to access it. Then go to **Social media** and pick your preferred film aspect ratio. Here I will choose Instagram Post.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Step 2:** Then upload the video to **Canva** to modify it and apply a border. To do so, go to the left pane and choose **Upload media** from the **Uploads** menu. Now navigate to the video's location and post it.

![upload media to canva](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-media-canva.jpg)

**Step 3:** The clip will appear under the **Videos** section in the **Uploads** category. To view the clip in the editing window, click on it. You may move the video around by dragging it.

(**Note:** If you'd rather use vibrant colors than plain old white borders, the color tab (top) provides a large color pallet to select from, as shown below).

**Conclusion**

Well, there you have it – how you can add borders to **Video Frame Instagram**. Undoubtedly, Instagram is among the most active social media platform to millions and billions of daily users. One particular growing trend among the Instagram users observed lately has been the addition of Borders to their videos or pictures to give it a more stylistic appeal.

That is why we decided to compile everything about those new users who cannot find their way to this. And for those users who already know the art, not only can they utilize excellent editing software such as **Filmora to add borders to video for Instagram** with ease, but they can also customize their borders by applying the color, blur, and other effects of their liking. Adding Instagram video border has never been easier!
