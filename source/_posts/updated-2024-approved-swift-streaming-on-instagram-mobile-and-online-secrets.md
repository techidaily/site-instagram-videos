![hyperlapse from instagram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hyperlapse-from-instagram.jpg)

You have the option of uploading a video from your iPhone or shooting a movie from inside the application. By default, your video is being played at a speed of 6X.

**Step 1:** Launch Hyperlapse on your iPhone, press the **record** button. Stop filming anytime you wish and keep your hands motionless.

**Step 2:** You'll see a speedometer now. The default speed is **6X**, but you may lower it to **1X** or boost it to **12X** if you choose. Move to the right to speed up the video.
