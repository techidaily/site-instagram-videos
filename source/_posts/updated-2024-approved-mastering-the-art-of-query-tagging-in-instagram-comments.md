## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1\. Can You Answer a Question After 24 Hours?

For the next 24 hours, your followers will be able to view your Story and reply to it. Afterward, when, as long as the Instagram Story is archived, you'll be allowed to see and react to inquiries.

### 2\. Does Instagram Tell You When Someone Answers Your Question?

Whenever anyone answers your question sticker, you'll get a notice. As previously noted, you may read the answers by viewing your Story and swiping up.

Even if you don't mention them, they'll get a message if you post anyone's response to your question sticker as a new Story. This guarantees that they will be notified when you respond to their query.

And, if you answer their query through DM, they'll be informed.

**The Takeaway!**
