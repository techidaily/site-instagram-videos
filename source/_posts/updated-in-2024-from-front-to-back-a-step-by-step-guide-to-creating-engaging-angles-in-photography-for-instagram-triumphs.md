When this happens, the video may not fit properly on the screen and appear distorted or sideways when posted on Instagram. This can be frustrating for users who have taken the time to capture a great video but need to share it as intended on the platform.

There are a few reasons why videos may appear sideways on Instagram. One of the most common causes is that the device's orientation was not properly set when the video was captured. Sometimes, videos may also appear sideways due to a glitch in the app or software used to capture the video.

To avoid videos appearing sideways on Instagram, it's important to always capture videos in portrait mode, set the orientation of your device correctly, and edit your videos to ensure they fit properly on the platform.
