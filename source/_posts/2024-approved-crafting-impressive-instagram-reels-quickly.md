#### Method 2: How To Make Reels Using with Wondershare Filmora Video Editor

Instagram does not limit you to the features embedded in it but allows you to create videos elsewhere and then upload them on Instagram as reels. Wondershare Filmora is one such app that will enable you to create your short videos quickly and easily.

The video editor has an array of powerful functions and tools that will let you be creative. The intuitive design and user-friendly interface are perfect for beginners.
