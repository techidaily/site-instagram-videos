Slow motion videos are frames that have been extended out and are moving at a reduced rate than normal video. It’s fantastic for giving a video a dramatic atmosphere and enhancing its atmospheric and aesthetic appeal.</p><p>Instagram is one platform that allows for brilliant slow-motion videos. But how to use the effect effectively is still a mystery to many. That’s why we deem it important to show our readers how you can create <strong>Slow Motion Instagram</strong> Videos!</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to Record Slow Motion Video in Instagram?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Record a Slow Motion Video on iPhone and Upload?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Make a Slow Motion Video for Instagram with Filmora?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Create Slow Motion Videos in Instagram Reels?</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Record-Slow-Motion-Video-in-Instagram"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Record-Slow-Motion-Video-in-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Record Slow Motion Video in Instagram"></a>Part 1: How to Record Slow Motion Video in Instagram</h2><p>Instagram is a platform that regularly provides its users with various special effects to enhance their stories and posts. Among the new set of effects introduced for Instagram Boomerang was the slow-motion effect. The effect would help reduce the Boomerang clips to half of their parent speed. You can record a slow motion Instagram story the same way too!</p><p>Follow the easy instructions here by using the new Boomerang settings to reduce speed to your footage with the SlowMo effect:</p><h3 id="Step-1-Open-Instagram"><a href="#Step-1-Open-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Open Instagram"></a>Step 1: Open Instagram</h3><p>Launch the <strong>Instagram app’s Story</strong> camera, and scroll down from the top of the screen before <strong>Boomerang mode</strong> appears (an infinity logo).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-boomerang-option.jpg"                      alt="create slow motion video on instagram - boomerang"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Start-Video-Recording"><a href="#Step-2-Start-Video-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Start Video Recording"></a>Step 2: Start Video Recording</h3><p>Begin filming the boomerang, then select the <strong>Infinity Symbol</strong> in the upper right corner after you’re finished.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/trim-tweak-boomerang-instagram.jpg"                      alt="edit instagram boomerang video"                ></p><h3 id="Step-3-Initiate-the-SlowMo-effect-to-Video"><a href="#Step-3-Initiate-the-SlowMo-effect-to-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Initiate the SlowMo effect to Video"></a>Step 3: Initiate the SlowMo effect to Video</h3><p>Next, from the drop-down menu, select the <strong>SlowMo effect</strong>, which is the second from the left side, to slow down the movie.</p><p><strong><em>GIFs, Texts</em></strong><em>, and <strong>Artwork</strong> may be added just like any other Instagram Story. After that, select the <strong>“Your Story”</strong> button at the bottom left of the page to publish your fresh slow motion clips in the manner you normally would.</em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-slow-motion-options.jpg"                      alt="instagram slow motion video"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Record-a-Slow-Motion-Video-on-iPhone-and-Upload-on-Instagram"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Record-a-Slow-Motion-Video-on-iPhone-and-Upload-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Record a Slow Motion Video on iPhone and Upload on Instagram"></a>Part 2: How to Record a Slow Motion Video on iPhone and Upload on Instagram</h2><p>Like Instagram, you can also record SlowMo videos on your iPhone. And it’s not too difficult either. If you used the iPhone’s standard camera app to make a video in SLO-MO format, only you have to do now is upload the captured slow motion clip to Instagram like every other video.</p><p>Whenever you record a video at SlowMo speed, it captures normally, but when you watch it back, you’ll see the slow-motion aspect. You may also modify your video so that the slow-motion movement begins and ends when you want it to.</p><p>Here is the informative step-by-step guide for you to learn and record Slo-Mo videos on iPhone and then upload them on Instagram:</p><h3 id="Step-1-Open-the-Camera-App"><a href="#Step-1-Open-the-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Open the Camera App"></a>Step 1: Open the Camera App</h3><p>First and foremost, you need to launch the camera on your iPhone. You will see a range of options inside the camera, such as video, photo, etc. Tap on the Slo-mo option.</p><p><strong><em>Note</em></strong><em>: For iPhone 12 and iPhone 11 models, you can also record video</em> <em>in Slo-mo effect with your frontal camera).</em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-slow-motion-options.jpg"                      alt="record instagram slow motion video on iPhone"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Start-Recording"><a href="#Step-2-Start-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Start Recording"></a>Step 2: Start Recording</h3><p>After tapping the Slo-mo option, you can either begin recording using the volume button or the record button itself inside the camera. And you can even tap on the Shutter option to capture a still photo during the recording process.</p><h3 id="Step-3-Edit-the-Video"><a href="#Step-3-Edit-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Edit the Video"></a>Step 3: Edit the Video</h3><p>Click the clip thumbnail, select <strong>Edit,</strong> to configure a section of the movie to display in slow motion while the remainder plays normally. To specify the portion, you wish to play again in slow motion, drag the vertical lines underneath the screen viewer.</p><p>You may modify the slow-motion frame rate and quality based on your device. Change the settings for slow-motion filming by going to <strong>Settings &gt; Camera &gt; Record Slo-mo.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-slow-motion-video-iphone.jpg"                      alt="edit instagram slow motion video on iPhone"                ></p><h3 id="Step-4-Upload-Video-to-Instagram"><a href="#Step-4-Upload-Video-to-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Upload Video to Instagram"></a>Step 4: Upload Video to Instagram</h3><p>After editing the video and finalizing the small details, all you have to do is <strong>Upload</strong> the slow-motion video Instagram by clicking on this + sign.</p><p><strong>Size and Length limitations for Instagram Video</strong></p><ul><li>The minimum length for <strong>vertical, horizontal</strong>, and <strong>squared videos</strong> respectively are: (<strong>600 X 750), (600 X 315)</strong>, and <strong>(600 x 600)</strong></li><li>The maximum file size should be no more than <strong>4GB</strong></li><li>Maximum frame rate is 30FPS</li><li>The maximum Instagram video length should be <strong>60 seconds</strong> for all videos.

It’s honestly your safest bet! While we understand using your smartphone to edit your videos and then uploading them to Instagram seems like a convenient choice, desktop offers a variety of features to top that. You can not only add music to your slow motion Instagram videos, but you can also add several animations via desktop. Not to mention the graphic text and stickers are there to enhance your SlowMo video engagement.</p><p>However, if you use the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can achieve much more.

Filmora provides aspect ratio presets such as 9:16, 1:1, 19:9, 4:3 even 21:9 cinema mode, and here I will take the 1:1 aspect ratio for example.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-instagram-aspect-ratio.jpg"                      alt="select instagram aspect ratio on Filmora"                ></p><p>And then drag and drop the video clip to the media library or the timeline panel directly to start the editing.</p><h3 id="Step-2-Create-Slow-Motion-Video-Instagram"><a href="#Step-2-Create-Slow-Motion-Video-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Create Slow Motion Video Instagram"></a>Step 2: Create Slow Motion Video Instagram</h3><p>Right click the video present on the timeline, and then click the <strong>Speed and Duration</strong> option from the context menu.

The Slow-motion feature allows users to create entertaining videos by transforming ordinary objects into something extraordinary and unique. Instagram lets you make reels with a variety of special effects. We will now show you how to use Instagram Reels to create Slow-motion videos.</p><p>Slow motion video recording has gotten incredibly simple on Instagram reels. Without the need for any other pricey software, the video may be slowed down easily and rapidly online. Now you can adjust the playing speed and experiment with it. Follow these simple steps to make your Reels video:</p><h3 id="Step-1-Launch-Instagram-and-Select-the-Reel-Option"><a href="#Step-1-Launch-Instagram-and-Select-the-Reel-Option" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Launch Instagram and Select the Reel Option"></a>Step 1: Launch Instagram and Select the Reel Option</h3><p>Launch the Instagram app. Once the main page opens, select the <strong>plus icon</strong> showing on the bottom end of the page. Then to enter the <strong>Reels video mode</strong>, select the <strong>Reels option</strong> from the bottom panel beside the story and live options.</p><h3 id="Step-2-Choose-a-Speed-Setting"><a href="#Step-2-Choose-a-Speed-Setting" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Choose a Speed Setting"></a>Step 2: Choose a Speed Setting</h3><p>After selecting the Reels option, tap on the <strong>Speed</strong> option to choose from one of the five <strong>Speed</strong> settings. The setting is set to 1x speed, which is the default speed setting. Now, if you want to record a slow-motion video, set the setting from 0.3x to 0.5x according to your preference.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-video-speed-options.jpg"                      alt="Create Instagram Reels Slow motion video"                ></p><h3 id="Step-3-Start-Recording"><a href="#Step-3-Start-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Start Recording"></a>Step 3: Start Recording</h3><p>Now that you’ve adjusted the speed, click on the <strong>Record</strong> button to begin recording your video. You can also add music by tapping on the <strong>audio</strong> option. If you want to watch the video you’ve recorded, tap on the arrow button and enjoy your video!</p><h2 id="FAQs-about-Instagram-Slow-Motion"><a href="#FAQs-about-Instagram-Slow-Motion" class="headerlink" title="FAQs about Instagram Slow Motion"></a>FAQs about Instagram Slow Motion</h2><ol><li><strong>Can I record only parts of the video in slow motion in Instagram Reel?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, you can. Instagram now also features the ability to record only a portion of a video that you want to slow down. You don’t have to record your Reels video all at once. You can also record it in shorter clips. Then you may combine all the short snippets to make a whole slow-motion video. This allows you to record a video at a quicker rate while recording all other videos at a standard rate. Only a piece of your movie will play at a sluggish speed, while the remainder will go nicely.</p><ol><li><strong>Why can’t I upload a slow motion video on Instagram?</strong></li></ol><p>To upload a slow-mo video on Instagram, you must first alter the video to a slow version and then save the video in a local file on your phones, because usually, you can save all types of videos on phones, but most phones don’t support a rendered version of a slow-mo video. After this, you should be able to upload the video directly to Instagram.</p><ol><li><strong>Besides slow motion, can I record fast-forward videos on Instagram?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, you can. Instagram features a fast-forward option. Select the speed option to change the video’s speed to fast speed. You can set the video at three different fast-forward speed settings: 1x, 2x, and 3x. Now it has become very simple to record a fast-forward video on Instagram.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-tailoring-igtv-titles-and-summaries-for-impact/"><u>[Updated] Tailoring IGTV Titles & Summaries for Impact</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/instagrams-backstage-pass-top-covert-strategies-revealed-for-2024/"><u>Instagram’s Backstage Pass  Top Covert Strategies Revealed for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-twisting-tales-in-photography-the-ultimate-guide-to-angled-spins-on-digital-platforms/"><u>2024 Approved  Twisting Tales in Photography  The Ultimate Guide to Angled Spins on Digital Platforms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-spotlight-on-stories-crafting-three-effective-highlights/"><u>[New] Spotlight on Stories  Crafting Three Effective Highlights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-10-free-instagram-story-viewers-to-watch-instagram-stories-anonymously-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] 10 FREE Instagram Story Viewers to Watch Instagram Stories Anonymously for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-demystifying-the-instagram-selfie-process-for-2024/"><u>[New] Demystifying the Instagram Selfie Process for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-precision-polling-on-instagram-crafting-survey-content/"><u>In 2024, Precision Polling on Instagram  Crafting Survey Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-from-followers-to-earnings-instagrams-complete-guide/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  From Followers to Earnings  Instagram's Complete Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-ultimate-routine-for-accessing-and-playing-fb-videos-via-apple-tv/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  The Ultimate Routine for Accessing and Playing FB Videos via Apple TV</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-best-kept-secrets-top-5-social-platforms-beyond-tiktok-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Best-Kept Secrets  Top 5 Social Platforms Beyond TikTok for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-compress-videos-like-a-pro-9-best-free-tools-for-windows-10/"><u>New 2024 Approved Compress Videos Like a Pro 9 Best Free Tools for Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-exploring-innovative-sequencing-with-gopros-burst-feature/"><u>[New] Exploring Innovative Sequencing with GoPro's Burst Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/5-tools-to-make-a-gif-meme/"><u>5 Tools to Make a GIF Meme</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-best-affordable-recorder-tools-in-open-source-market/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Best Affordable Recorder Tools in Open Source Market</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-step-by-step-guide-to-finding-your-apple-id-on-your-iphone-8-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, A Step-by-Step Guide to Finding Your Apple ID On Your iPhone 8</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

If you want, you can also come up with a puzzle feed on Instagram via Canva from scratch. It is a freely available online editor that offers tons of templates and options to create social media posts.</p><p>Here’s how you can also come up with a customizable puzzle feed for Instagram using Canva:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Choose to work on a custom design on Canva</strong></p><p>At first, you can just go to the official website of Canva, log in to your account, and choose to work on a Custom Design from its home. Here, you can enter the size as 3240x3240 pixels to work on a set of 3x3 images (since an ideal Instagram post is of 1080x1080 pixels).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/login-canva-make-puzzle-feed.jpg"                      alt="login canva make puzzle feed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Add Grids to your Custom Design on Canva</strong></p><p>This will simply open a new canvas on your interface so that you can add all kinds of elements. Now, go to the sidebar and under the Elements section, look for “Grids”. From here, you can add a 3x3 grid to get 9 equal images. If you want, you can make a grid and canvas of any other preferred size as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-grids-to-puzzle-feed.jpg"                      alt="add grids to puzzle feed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Add Elements and Photos to your Grid</strong></p><p>Once the grid is created, you can just drag and drop all kinds of elements or pictures on it. At first, I would recommend adding photos so that you can easily place them and get their right placement on the canvas.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-elements-to-grid.jpg"                      alt="add elements to grid"                ></p><p>Following the same approach, you can find all kinds of elements on the sidebar that you can add to your grid. For instance, you can add headlines, texts, lines, vectors, and so much more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/add-photo-to-grid.jpg"                      alt="add photo to grid"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Split and Post your Photos on Instagram</strong></p><p>That’s it! Once you have worked on the entire grid, you can go to the Export button and save the entire grid image on your system. Later, you can use any free solution (like Pine Tools) to split the grid into individual 1080x1080 photos for your Instagram feed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/split-grid-ig-puzzle.jpg"                      alt="split grid ig puzzle"                ></p><p>In this way, you can easily explore your creative side to make all kinds of puzzle feeds for Instagram via Canva.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Effective-Instagram-Puzzle-Feed-Ideas"><a href="#Part-5-Effective-Instagram-Puzzle-Feed-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Effective Instagram Puzzle Feed Ideas"></a>Part 5: Effective Instagram Puzzle Feed Ideas</h2><p>As you can see, it can be quite easy to come up with a puzzle feed for Instagram on Canva. To get even better results, you can consider implementing these Instagram puzzle feed ideas as well.</p><h4 id="Less-is-More"><a href="#Less-is-More" class="headerlink" title="Less is More"></a>Less is More</h4><p>A lot of people make the rookie mistake of adding too many design elements while creating an Instagram puzzle feed. Remember, your focus should be on your content and other elements are there to simply elevate the visual appeal of your feed.</p><h4 id="Be-Consistent"><a href="#Be-Consistent" class="headerlink" title="Be Consistent"></a>Be Consistent</h4><p>If you have just started with a puzzle theme on Instagram, then be consistent and stick to it for a while. For instance, if you would keep changing the overall theme after every 9 posts, then it will make your account look cluttered.</p><h4 id="Consider-your-account’s-theme"><a href="#Consider-your-account’s-theme" class="headerlink" title="Consider your account’s theme"></a>Consider your account’s theme</h4><p>Don’t go with any free or paid Instagram puzzle feed just because it looks appealing. You should consider the overall theme of your brand or personal account. The template should reflect the idea of your business. For instance, luxury brands can go with bold colors while fashion influencers can have some contrasting gradients on their template.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>I’m sure that after reading this guide, you would be able to pick the perfect puzzle feed for your Instagram account.

But don’t worry – you don’t have to resort to shady tactics to get more followers. There are several things you can do that are both easy and effective.</p><p>This post will outline 12 of the best ways to get 1,000 followers every month on Instagram.</p><h2 id="How-to-Get-1K-Followers-Every-Month-on-Instagram"><a href="#How-to-Get-1K-Followers-Every-Month-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How to Get 1K Followers Every Month on Instagram"></a>How to Get 1K Followers Every Month on Instagram</h2><ol><li>Establish a Strong Social Media Presence.</li><li>Optimize Your Profile.</li><li>Know your audience.</li><li>Post at the right time of day.</li><li>Use Hashtags to Reach a Wider Audience</li><li>Engage with Other Users</li><li>Post-User-Generated Content</li><li>Collaborate with Influencers</li><li>Share Your Instagram Profile on Other Platforms</li><li>Take Advantage of Instagram Stories</li><li>Tag Brands in Your Posts</li><li>Follow the Right People</li></ol><p>So read on and start growing your following today!</p><p><strong>#1. Establish a Strong Social Media Presence</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-01.jpg"                      alt="establish a strong social media presence"                ></p><p>To establish a solid social media presence, you need to make sure you’re posting regularly. That means posting interesting, engaging content that will get people talking.</p><p>But it’s not just about quantity – it’s also about quality. Make sure your posts are well-written and offer something unique or insightful that will add value to your followers’ lives. If you can do all of that, you’ll be on your way to social media success.</p><p><strong>#2. Optimize Your Profile</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-02.jpg"                      alt="optimize your profile"                ></p><p>Ensure your Instagram profile is complete, including a catchy bio and profile photo. Fill out all of the necessary information in the “Contact” section so that users can easily reach out to you.</p><p><strong>#3. Know your audience</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-03.jpg"                      alt="know your audience"                ></p><p>There’s no point in creating a great Instagram account if you don’t know who your target audience is, what they like and dislike, what they are interested in, and what they aren’t interested in. You need to know as much about them as possible before you start growing your following because this will help you create content that appeals to them.</p><p><strong>#4. Post at the right time of day</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-04.jpg"                      alt="post at the right time of day"                ></p><p>As with most social media platforms, there are best times to post on Instagram. These vary depending on your audience, but the best time to post is between 9 am and 11 am EST (12 pm-2 pm GMT), 1 pm and 3 pm EST (4 pm-6 pm GMT) or between 6:30 pm and 8:30 pm EST (8:30 am – 10:30 am GMT).</p><p>There’s no exact science behind this; it’s just what has worked best in my experience as well as that of other Instagram marketing pros I’ve spoken with. The key is consistency—posting at different times makes you appear more human than if you were posting at exactly the same time every day—but not too much so that users get annoyed by how often they see new posts from you each day!</p><p><strong>#5. Use Hashtags to Reach a Wider Audience</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-05.jpg"                      alt="use hashtags to reach a wider audience"                ></p><p>Using relevant hashtags is a great way to make your content more visible and accessible to people looking for what you have to offer. Hashtags can help you connect with like-minded people and grow your online community.</p><p>So, start using hashtags today and see the difference it makes to your content strategy!</p><p><strong>#6. Engage with Other Users</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-06.jpg"                      alt="engage with other users"                ></p><p>You can’t just rely on others to come to you – go out and engage with them! Like and comment on other Instagrammers’ posts, follow them and participate in Instagram challenges or Instagram pods (groups of Instagrammers who support each other by liking and commenting on each other’s content).</p><p><strong>#7. Post-User-Generated Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-07.jpg"                      alt="post-user-generated content"                ></p><p>Encourage your followers to tag you in their Instagram posts featuring your product or brand. This not only gets more eyes on your profile but also builds trust and customer loyalty. And don’t forget to thank them for the shoutout!</p><p><strong>#8. Collaborate with Influencers</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-08.jpg"                      alt="collaborate with influencers"                ></p><p>Partnering with Instagram influencers in your industry can introduce you to their large following and vice versa. This can result in a significant boost in your Instagram followers.</p><p><strong>#9. Share Your Instagram Profile on Other Platforms</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-09.jpg"                      alt="share your instagram profile on other platforms"                ></p><p>Don’t forget to promote your Instagram on other social media platforms and your website or blog. Put the link in your bio and include it in any relevant posts or newsletters.</p><p><strong>#10. Take Advantage of Instagram Stories</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-10.jpg"                      alt="take advantage of instagram stories"                ></p><p>Instagram stories have become increasingly popular and offer a fun way for users to interact with your brand or business. Use them to showcase behind-the-scenes content, exclusive offers, or Q&amp;As with followers. And don’t forget to add relevant Instagram story hashtags or location tags to increase visibility.</p><p><strong>#11. Tag Brands in Your Posts</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-11.jpg"                      alt="tag brands in your post"                ></p><p>If using products from a specific brand, don’t forget to tag them in your Instagram posts. This not only helps increase visibility for both parties, but it can also result in potential collaborations.</p><p><strong>#12. Follow the Right People</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-12.jpg"                      alt="follow the right people"                ></p><p>Follow Instagrammers in the same industry as you who post content relevant to your brand or business. This can help drive more traffic to your profile and potentially result in new followers.</p><h2 id="Takeaway"><a href="#Takeaway" class="headerlink" title="Takeaway"></a>Takeaway</h2><p>The takeaway from this article is to understand how to use the Instagram algorithm and how it works. So, what are the main points you should take away from this?</p><ul><li>The Instagram algorithm is an important concept for all brands to understand.

Also, you can post a snippet of at most 15 seconds since that is the maximum duration of an Instagram story. To learn how to add music to the IG story, you can follow these simple steps right away:</p><h4 id="1-Select-the-Music-feature-for-IG-story"><a href="#1-Select-the-Music-feature-for-IG-story" class="headerlink" title="1.

If you want, you can tap on the search bar and enter keywords for songs, artists, albums, etc. to look for anything specific.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-taylor-swift-songs.jpg"                      alt="Select Taylor Swift Songs"                ></p><p>Once you find the song of your choice, just tap on it and it will be loaded on the Instagram Story interface.

One of the best ways to do that is by using a reliable <strong>Instagram grid maker</strong>. For instance, with an Instagram grid planner, you can come up with an overall theme for your profile or connect various posts via a puzzle. To help you elevate the creative and visual appeal of your profile, I’m going to make you familiar with the 10 best grid makers for Instagram.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What are Instagram Grids All About?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: The 6 Best Online Grid Makers for Instagram</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Top 4 Grid Makers for Instagram [for Android and iOS]</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Make an Appealing Photo Grid on Instagram?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Creative Ideas to Implement Instagram Grid Layouts</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Instagram-Grids-All-About"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Instagram-Grids-All-About" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Instagram Grids All About?"></a>Part 1: What are Instagram Grids All About?</h2><p>You might already know that Instagram displays our posts in a 3-column layout. Therefore, to make the most of this layout, a lot of people work on the overall 3x3 grid (3 rows and 3 columns).</p><p>To catch the attention of their audience, you can come up with an overall theme for your profile using 9 posts (a 3x3 grid).

This would make the overall profile look uniform and more aesthetically pleasing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/what-are-instagram-grids.jpg"                      alt="what are instagram grids"                ></p><p>Just like this, there can be so many ways in which we can plan the layout of a grid for our Instagram profile.</p><h2 id="Part-2-The-6-Best-Online-Grid-Makers-for-Instagram"><a href="#Part-2-The-6-Best-Online-Grid-Makers-for-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The 6 Best Online Grid Makers for Instagram"></a>Part 2: The 6 Best Online Grid Makers for Instagram</h2><p>In case you are also looking for an online Instagram grid maker, then you can simply explore these options:</p><h4 id="1-My-Social-Boutique"><a href="#1-My-Social-Boutique" class="headerlink" title="1.

To use this free photo grid Instagram tool, just go through these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Upload the image you want to split</strong></p><p>At first, you can just go to the official website of Image Splitter by Postcron and click on the “Upload Image” button from its home. This will open a dedicated Instagram grid maker online tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/upload-image-splitter.jpg"                      alt="upload image splitter"                ></p><p>You can now just drag and drop an image that you want to split or click on the “Upload” button to browse and load it from your computer.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Choose how you want to split the image</strong></p><p>Great! Once the image has been loaded, you can simply check its preview on the side. Now, you can just crop the part of the image that you want to split from here. On the side, you can just enter the number of rows and columns in which you want to split the image. For instance, to get a 3x3 Instagram grid layout, you can set the number of columns and rows as 3.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/choose-how-split-image.jpg"                      alt="choose how split image"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Split your image and save all photos</strong></p><p>After setting a preferred ratio for the grid, you can also select a respective image format to export your files (like JPG or PNG).

To get better results for your Instagram’s grid layout, you can consider following these expert suggestions:</p><h4 id="Consistency-is-the-key"><a href="#Consistency-is-the-key" class="headerlink" title="Consistency is the key"></a>Consistency is the key</h4><p>A lot of people simply think that coming up with 9 posts for Instagram would make your profile look visually appealing. It might attract your audience, but you need to maintain a consistent appeal throughout your profile. To do that, you need to ensure that all the upcoming posts would follow the same pattern and appeal.</p><h4 id="Align-it-with-your-brand’s-vision"><a href="#Align-it-with-your-brand’s-vision" class="headerlink" title="Align it with your brand’s vision"></a>Align it with your brand’s vision</h4><p>Don’t come up with a grid layout for Instagram just for the sake of it. You need to make sure that it is aligned with the overall look and feel of your brand. Also, your Instagram page should remain authentic with the message of your brand and its image.</p><h4 id="Focus-on-color-combinations"><a href="#Focus-on-color-combinations" class="headerlink" title="Focus on color combinations"></a>Focus on color combinations</h4><p>Just splitting your images into a 3x3 grid is not enough. You need to maintain the overall visual appeal of your profile by sticking to certain color combinations. You can either maintain a single-colored layout or mix two or three colors to come up with a consistent look.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/fashion-puzzle-template-ig.jpg"                      alt="fashion puzzle template ig"                ></p><h4 id="Preview-before-posting"><a href="#Preview-before-posting" class="headerlink" title="Preview before posting"></a>Preview before posting</h4><p>Most importantly, try to get a preview of your Instagram grid before posting it on your profile. There are all kinds of preview apps (mobile and online) that you can try to do the same. In this way, you can easily notice if there is an alignment issue with your photos before posting them on your profile.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Well, now it’s your turn to come up with some stunning grid layouts for your Instagram profile! I’m sure that you can easily select the best Instagram grid maker from this handpicked list. You can use either of these Instagram grid makers (online or mobile tools) to meet your requirements. Just make sure you follow a consistent appeal and have a planned storytelling approach that would help you attain an impressive presence on Instagram for sure.</p><p><img

How should we organise our Instagram business profile, and how can we keep it separate from our personal accounts? Here, we’ll investigate how to create an Instagram business account so that your business can benefit from this massively popular social network too.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">How to set up Instagram Business Account</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Should you switch to business account?</a></li></ul><h2 id="How-to-set-up-Instagram-Business-Account"><a href="#How-to-set-up-Instagram-Business-Account" class="headerlink" title="How to set up Instagram Business Account"></a>How to set up Instagram Business Account</h2><p> Making the move to an Instagram business account is straightforward, so here’s a step by step introduction to setting up your Instagram business profile in moments.</p><h4 id="1-Switch-to-Instagram-business-profile"><a href="#1-Switch-to-Instagram-business-profile" class="headerlink" title="1.  Switch to Instagram business profile"></a>1.  Switch to Instagram business profile</h4><p> Log into your personal Instagram account to start this process. If you don’t have an account, you’ll need to create an Instagram account to get started.</p><p> Once into your Instagram account, simply open your account settings which you’ll find in the cog at the top right of your screen when looking at your profile. Near the bottom of the menu you’ll find the option to ‘Switch to Business Profile’. Choose this to find out how to create Instagram business account.</p><h4 id="2-Set-up-your-profile"><a href="#2-Set-up-your-profile" class="headerlink" title="2.  Set up your profile"></a>2.  Set up your profile</h4><p> Once you’ve pressed the option to switch to a business profile, you’ll see a request to connect your Instagram account to your Facebook page, with a blue link to ‘view features’. This is how to create Instagram account for your business.</p><p> In this menu you’ll be able to connect to your Facebook page, which is the best place to start. You’ll be asked which Facebook page you want to connect to; note that you can only set up an Instagram business account for pages which you administer yourself. You may only connect one Instagram business profile with each Facebook page.</p><p> From here, you can pull down contact information such as your customer service telephone number, your street address and your email contacts. You need to add at least one contact feature in order to create your Instagram business account.</p><h4 id="3-Check-your-new-Instagram-business-profile"><a href="#3-Check-your-new-Instagram-business-profile" class="headerlink" title="3.  Check your new Instagram business profile"></a>3.  Check your new Instagram business profile</h4><p> Once you’ve finished setting up your account, you can switch back to your personal account and navigate to your new Instagram business account to see how it looks from an outsider’s point of view. Try tapping the ‘contact’ button to see what sort of interaction options are available to your visitors.</p><p> Make sure you are only providing the relevant information at this stage. For example, if you are a fully online business, your customers won’t need to get directions to your address, so you can go ahead and remove your location from the contact options. If you don’t really use the phone number for business, you can choose to switch it to text message only within your Instagram business profile settings.</p><h4 id="4-Check-out-Instagram-for-business-features"><a href="#4-Check-out-Instagram-for-business-features" class="headerlink" title="4.  Check out Instagram for business features"></a>4.  Check out Instagram for business features</h4><p> Now you know how to create Instagram business account, you also need to manage it well too. There are a few features which set business accounts apart from standard user accounts, and some of these can be very useful to you in getting the most from your new Instagram business profile.</p><ul><li><strong>Insights:</strong> You’ll find the insights button at the top of your business profile next to the settings icon. Here you can see impressions, reach and clicks to your website, which are updated on a weekly basis. This feature also tracks your engagement metrics on a post by post basis, so that you can tailor what you’re posting to get more from your channel.</li><li><strong>Promote:</strong> Posts in Instagram can be boosted in a similar way to those on Facebook. This is not the same as running an ad, which you could also consider doing, but is a way to ensure more people see the content that you’ve posted.</li><li><strong>Profile:</strong> Your Instagram business profile looks and feels different to the generic user account, which is a good thing. It allows users to find out about your business, to get directions or contact information for you and to click shoppable links directly.</li></ul><p> Take some time to get to know your new Instagram business account, so that you can set in place a powerful strategy to maximize your impact on this busy social channel.</p><p> So, now you know how to create Instagram business account and how to manage it too, but one question remains; should you?</p><h2 id="Should-you-switch-to-business-account"><a href="#Should-you-switch-to-business-account" class="headerlink" title="Should you switch to business account?"></a>Should you switch to business account?</h2><p> With more than 800 million users and 500 million active each day, Instagram is by far the biggest and busiest social sharing network on the planet. But are there real advantages to switching to an Instagram business profile, or could you just promote your business through a standard account instead? Let’s find out:</p><h4 id="Pros-of-switching-to-an-Instagram-business-account"><a href="#Pros-of-switching-to-an-Instagram-business-account" class="headerlink" title="Pros of switching to an Instagram business account"></a>Pros of switching to an Instagram business account</h4><p> Some of the real advantages of working with a business account include:</p><ul><li><strong>Getting found more easily:</strong> Prior to Instagram business profiles being included in the platform, the only way your customers could find or contact you was by visiting your page and clicking the link to your website. The new profiles make it much easier for people to find you, contact you and, of course, buy your products. Useful analytics: In the past, the only way to draw down analytics from Instagram was through third party apps. With the new Instagram business profile, you can monitor your posts, clicks, engagement and reach all in one simple place. This will help inform your activity on Instagram and allow you to spend your time on the most productive activities.</li><li><strong>Paid ad options:</strong> Alongside the roll out of business profiles, Instagram have beefed up their ad options too. When you hit a post on your business account, there is an option at the bottom to ‘promote’ that post. From here, you can add a call to action button, target specific audiences and choose when the ad should be run. Both boost posts and paid ads are possible with the powerful tools built into Instagram.</li><li><strong>Links on Stories:</strong> Now business Instagram accounts who have at least 10,000 followers can add links into their Stories. Stories act like promoted posts, appearing at the top of your user’s news feed and encouraging engagement, so having active links to products or your website here is gold dust.</li></ul><p> You must admit, there are some pretty powerful reasons for knowing how to create Instagram account for your business, many of which could see your enterprise drawing in new customers and new opportunities. But is that the whole story?</p><h4 id="Drawbacks-of-the-Instagram-business-profile"><a href="#Drawbacks-of-the-Instagram-business-profile" class="headerlink" title="Drawbacks of the Instagram business profile"></a>Drawbacks of the Instagram business profile</h4><p> As with any new features, there are also some drawbacks to owning an Instagram business account. Here’s what you need to be aware of when thinking about how to create Instagram account for your company:</p><ul><li><strong>Facebook requirement:</strong> In order to set up a business account on Instagram you also need to have an existing Facebook page for your business. However, the majority of businesses already make use of Facebook, and if you don’t, then you probably should.</li><li><strong>Engagement problems:</strong> Instagram is owned by Facebook, and just like Facebook, they want you to pay for ads. While they are fairly tight lipped about how their post visibility algorithm works, some users have reported a negative impact on their engagement as a result of switching. The data on this is limited at this stage, but it’s worth keeping in mind if you’re not a business willing to pay for your exposure.</li></ul><p> So now you know how to create Instagram business account functionality, and how to use it, as well as whether it’s a good idea for you. Will you make the switch?</p><h2 id="And-the-winner-is"><a href="#And-the-winner-is" class="headerlink" title="And the winner is?"></a>And the winner is?</h2><p> Right now, more than 15 million businesses are already using an Instagram business account, so in order to keep up with the competition, it makes sense to make the switch.

Don’t you worry anymore; Instagram has got it all! Over the years, Instagram has introduced many new features and has become a one-stop-shop for social media users.</p><p>Instagram initially started with the option of only uploading pictures in 2010. Two years later, in 2012, Mark Zuckerberg bought Instagram, and since then, it has been a competitor to many apps. Introducing the chat feature, stories, IGTV, and its most recent update of the Instagram Reels, Instagram continues to seize the market. It is now the sixth most popular social media platform with more than one billion active users.</p><p>Here, in this article, we will familiarize you with how to make and create reels on Instagram and 10 interesting facts about the latest update.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">10 Facts You Need to Know about Instagram Reels</a></li><li><a href="#part2">FAQs about Instagram Reels</a></li></ul><h2 id="10-Facts-You-Need-to-Know-about-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#10-Facts-You-Need-to-Know-about-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="10 Facts You Need to Know about Instagram Reels"></a>10 Facts You Need to Know about Instagram Reels</h2><p>Instagramreels are short 15-second multi-clip videos with audio, effects, and other exciting editing tools.

Why Instagram launched Reels? Copy TikTok?"></a>#1. Why Instagram launched Reels? Copy TikTok?</h3><p>As a competitor to various apps, Instagram has adapted to the latest trends pretty quickly. With the boom of TikTok, Instagram followed suit and launched Reels to attract content creators and different brands. During the lockdown, people all over the world have taken over TikTok to get rid of their boredom. Instagram Reels is practically the same thing as TikTok. The few differences are that Instagram provides many other features as well but on the other hand time limit on TikTok is up to 1 minute. Furthermore, Reels disappear after 24 hours, where TikTok videos don’t.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-why-launch-instagram.jpg"                      alt="why launch instagram"                ></p><h3 id="2-Instagram-Reels-was-first-launched-in-Brazil"><a href="#2-Instagram-Reels-was-first-launched-in-Brazil" class="headerlink" title="#2. Instagram Reels was first launched in Brazil"></a>#2. Instagram Reels was first launched in Brazil</h3><p>Instagram launched the Reels update for a trail run in Brazil in November 2019. It allowed Reels to be shared on Stories or via DMs. It is called Cenas in Brazil and is part of the Instagram Stories instead of a separate application.</p><h3 id="3-Instagram-reaches-over-1-Billion-users-every-month"><a href="#3-Instagram-reaches-over-1-Billion-users-every-month" class="headerlink" title="#3. Instagram reaches over 1 Billion users every month"></a>#3. Instagram reaches over 1 Billion users every month</h3><p>Instagram is a worldwide platform that reaches over a billion users every month. This number signifies how widespread its expansion is. Instagram is a site for everyone, be it a regular person, a business, or a celebrity. Its reach encourages people to make accounts and take different business or other initiatives with ease. Introducing the Reels feature will surely increase the number of users as it will attract users of TikTok as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-instagram-active-user.jpg"                      alt="instagram active user"                ></p><h3 id="4-Instagram-Reels-is-available-in-50-countries-now"><a href="#4-Instagram-Reels-is-available-in-50-countries-now" class="headerlink" title="#4.

Much of this credit goes to the governments of these countries. In December 2019, Trump tried to get TikTok banned. When the position of TikTok was up for grabs, Facebook immediately acted upon it. Similarly, as TikTok has been banned in India, Instagram users are thrilled to get a similar platform where they can make multi-clip videos.</p><h3 id="6-NBA-franchises-are-very-active-on-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#6-NBA-franchises-are-very-active-on-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="#6.

It is handy for people who don’t get the time to interact with sports otherwise. They can now get all the info from Insta!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-nba-franchises-on-reels.jpg"                      alt="NBA franchises on reels"                ></p><h3 id="7-The-top-5-creators-on-Instagram-Reels-are-Netflix-Red-Bull-Louis-Vuitton-Asos-NBA-Basketball"><a href="#7-The-top-5-creators-on-Instagram-Reels-are-Netflix-Red-Bull-Louis-Vuitton-Asos-NBA-Basketball" class="headerlink" title="#7.

The top 5 creators on Instagram Reels are Netflix, Red Bull, Louis Vuitton, Asos, NBA Basketball</h3><p>Even though Instagram Reels does not offer any ad formats or sponsored content, yet different companies have taken advantage of the Reels to promote their products.

Red Bull, Louis Vuitton, and Asos have also made Reels featuring their products, maximizing customer engagement. Finally, as mentioned above, NBA franchises are also making their contribution to the success of the Reels.</p><h3 id="8-Shopping-is-coming-to-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#8-Shopping-is-coming-to-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="#8.

Well, since its launch, it has caught the attention of many TikTok users, but it still has a long way to go before it can completely replace TikTok.

However, we are sure that Facebook will not give up so quickly and continue to update Instagram.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-instagram-reels-replace-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="instagram reels replace tiktok"                ></p><h2 id="FAQs-about-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#FAQs-about-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="FAQs about Instagram Reels"></a>FAQs about Instagram Reels</h2><p><strong>Q: How can I find Reels on Instagram?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> To find different Reels to watch, go to the Explore page.

You must also check the engagement rate created by the influencer as it reveals how much the audience loves to interact with or loves the style of the influencer.</p><p> Once you build a relationship with your ideal influencer on Instagram, generating high quality leads is vital for an Instagram Influencer Marketing campaign.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-right-insta-influencer.JPG"                      alt="find influencer"                ></p><h3 id="Step-3-Reach-Out-Influencers"><a href="#Step-3-Reach-Out-Influencers" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Reach Out Influencers"></a>Step 3: Reach Out Influencers</h3><p> Do you have an assumption that influencers will work just because you are remunerating them? Then, you are completely wrong as the influencers only promote your product if they believe in it.</p><p> As the influencers are picky, it is good for your brand value. Your first impression and the pitching process must be good with your influencer. You may send them a mail with your brief introduction or directly message them introducing your brand and how much you like the motivational messages from the influencer.</p><p> This is a positive way of discussing things and still, if your ideal influencer declines your messages, you may thank them and ask them to connect with you any time they like. This doesn’t create any animosity between you and your influencer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reach-out-insta-influencer.JPG"                      alt="reach out influencer"                ></p><h3 id="Step-4-Consider-Your-Budget"><a href="#Step-4-Consider-Your-Budget" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Consider Your Budget"></a>Step 4: Consider Your Budget</h3><p> Deciding the budget can be quite a task. No one ever likes to pay more than the desired but you would also not like to offer peanuts. The budget depends on the size and value of your company. It depends on how much you can shell out and what is the value you can obtain from the Influencer.</p><p> According to the survey, an average influencer charges around $271. The influencers with a minimum following have better rates of engagement than the influencer with a huge audience base.</p><p> The influencer with a bigger following cannot be completely ignored. But, the micro-influencers have lower rates than the big influencers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/budget-video-service.JPG"                      alt="budget instagram influencer marketing"                ></p><h3 id="Step-5-Calculate-ROI"><a href="#Step-5-Calculate-ROI" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Calculate ROI"></a>Step 5: Calculate ROI</h3><p> Is the Instagram influencer marketing reaping in profits? How do you know that? Measuring and tracking the campaigns can show you the results. It depends on your goals. When you try selling a bulk product, setting up a link tracker for your influencer can help in calculating the ROI. When you are focused on awareness of your brand, you must use the Instagram Analytics tool. The more brand hashtags used, the better are the returns.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/roi.JPG"                      alt="roi instagram influencer marketing"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> You must make a proper strategy, be selective about the ideal influencer you work with and never forget to track the efforts made by you if you want your Instagram Influencer marketing campaign to work.

Also, you can post a snippet of at most 15 seconds since that is the maximum duration of an Instagram story. To learn how to add music to the IG story, you can follow these simple steps right away:</p><h4 id="1-Select-the-Music-feature-for-IG-story"><a href="#1-Select-the-Music-feature-for-IG-story" class="headerlink" title="1.

Naturally, in order to be able to use IGTV, you must have an Instagram account, so before you take any other steps, make sure that you are signed in to your account on Instagram.</p><h4 id="Creating-an-IGTV-Channel"><a href="#Creating-an-IGTV-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Creating an IGTV Channel"></a>Creating an IGTV Channel</h4><p>Launch the Instagram app, and then tap on the <strong>Settings icon</strong> located in the upper right corner. Pick the <strong>Create Channel</strong> option and that is it, you will now be able to add videos to your IGTV channel or browse and watch videos other creators post on their channels.</p><h4 id="Uploading-Videos-to-IGTV-Using-the-Instagram-or-the-IGTV-app"><a href="#Uploading-Videos-to-IGTV-Using-the-Instagram-or-the-IGTV-app" class="headerlink" title="Uploading Videos to IGTV Using the Instagram or the IGTV app"></a>Uploading Videos to IGTV Using the Instagram or the IGTV app</h4><p>It doesn’t really matter which of these two apps you decide to use to upload videos to your IGTV channel, because the process is identical. Simply tap on the <strong>IGTV icon</strong> that looks like, well, a TV with an antenna and then tap on the <strong>+ icon</strong> to add a video from your camera roll. Keep in mind that videos that last more than a couple of minutes can be huge in size and that it might be better to upload videos to your IGTV channel from a computer if the video is larger than one or two gigabytes.</p><p>Write a description of the video and give it a catchy title before hitting the <strong>Post button</strong>. Optionally, you can <strong>enable the share to Facebook option</strong> even before you post the video to your IGTV channel, but you can also share a video to different social media platforms after you posted it to IGTV.</p><h4 id="Uploading-Videos-to-IGTV-from-a-Computer"><a href="#Uploading-Videos-to-IGTV-from-a-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Uploading Videos to IGTV from a Computer"></a>Uploading Videos to IGTV from a Computer</h4><p>Open your web browser and head over to <strong>instagram.com.</strong> If you’re not already signed in, you’ll be asked to provide the <strong>login information</strong>, so once you’ve inserted your <strong>username and password</strong> you’ll be able to see your Instagram feed. Click on the icon located next to the heart-shaped icon that displays all the notifications, located in the top right corner, in order to gain access to your Instagram channel.</p><p>Proceed to click on the <strong>IGTV icon</strong>, and then click on the <strong>Upload button</strong>. Once a new page loads you can <strong>upload a cover photo</strong> or add a <strong>description and a title</strong>. On the left side of the screen you will be able to see a <strong>+ icon</strong> and below it, you’ll see the <strong>Drag and Drop a Video File</strong> message. You can either <strong>drag and drop</strong> a video file from a folder to the designated area of the screen or you can click on the <strong>+ icon</strong> and navigate to the folder in which the file you want to upload is located. If you would like to <strong>share the video on Facebook and IGTV at the same time</strong>, you must first <strong>connect your IGTV to your Facebook page</strong>. Afterward, you should simply <strong>click on the IGTV and Facebook page option</strong> to enable it and proceed to click on the Post button and the bottom of the screen.</p><h4 id="Video-Upload-Requirements-for-IGTV"><a href="#Video-Upload-Requirements-for-IGTV" class="headerlink" title="Video Upload Requirements for IGTV"></a>Video Upload Requirements for IGTV</h4><p>Even though IGTV videos can last up to <strong>sixty minutes</strong>, this option is <strong>reserved for verified accounts.</strong> Regular IGTV creators can only upload videos that <strong>last from fifteen seconds up to ten minutes.</strong> In addition, you can only upload <strong>MP4 video</strong> files to your IGTV channel, since the platform <strong>doesn’t support any other video file format</strong> at the moment.</p><p>Currently, the size of a video can’t exceed <strong>560 MB</strong> for videos between <strong>15 seconds and ten minutes,</strong> while the maximum file size for a sixty-minute videos is limited to <strong>3.6 GB</strong>. IGTV videos have to be vertical, and the content you upload must have a minimum <strong>4:5 aspect ratio, while the maximum aspect ratio is 9:16.</strong></p><h2 id="Tips-for-Uploading-and-Posting-Videos-to-IGTV"><a href="#Tips-for-Uploading-and-Posting-Videos-to-IGTV" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Uploading and Posting Videos to IGTV"></a>Tips for Uploading and Posting Videos to IGTV</h2><p>Despite the fact that you can now upload videos that last for an entire hour, it is still better to keep the content you share on your IGTV channel short. Videos that <strong>last between two and five minutes</strong> are best suited for the audience on social media. Posting videos that surpass the five-minute limit can prove to be counterproductive because people won’t take the time to watch them from start to finish.</p><p>Aside from YouTube, a majority of videos on social media platforms are watched without sound. That’s why adding subtitles to your video may be a good idea, but just remember that you have to hardcode the subtitles into the video since SRT files don’t work well with vertical videos.</p><h2 id="Analyzing-and-Promoting-an-IGTV-Channel"><a href="#Analyzing-and-Promoting-an-IGTV-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Analyzing and Promoting an IGTV Channel"></a>Analyzing and Promoting an IGTV Channel</h2><p>After uploading a video to IGTV you can monitor the number of <strong>likes, comments, and views</strong> by tapping on the <strong>‘three dots’ icon</strong> located next to the <strong>Like, Comment and Share icons</strong> on a particular video. A <strong>drop-down menu will appear</strong> on the screen and you should tap on the <strong>View Insights</strong> option in order to see how many <strong>views, likes and comments</strong> your video got. Below the <strong>Engagement information</strong>, you can find the <strong>Audience Retention</strong> menu that offers <strong>Average Percentage Watch</strong> information as well as <strong>a drop-off graph</strong> that tells you at which point viewers stop watching your video. The data provided by the IGTV analytics can be extremely valuable when planning future posts on IGTV.
