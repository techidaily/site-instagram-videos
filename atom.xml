Snapseed is considered one of the best Instagram photo editor apps on Android, and it’s available on iOS too. Even better; it’s free!</p><p>Snapseed comes with 26 built-in tools and filters, including popular options like lens blur, HDR Scape, and vintage filters. You can even remove people from your selfies and isolate individual items in your image for separate editing from the rest. It’s considered one of the best image editors for serious photographers, which can mean there’s a rather steep learning curve but a climb certainly worth making judging by the spectacular results.</p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/snapseed/id439438619?mt=8" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niksoftware.snapseed" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="2-Adobe-Photoshop-Express"><a href="#2-Adobe-Photoshop-Express" class="headerlink" title="2.

Free on iOS and Android, but with in-app purchases for the advanced features.</p><p>Expect to find all the usual tools such as crop, straighten and rotate, as well as tools to smooth, balance and remove red eye. If you’re keen to fork out for the advanced features, there’s even the ability to add objects from other photos to your images, creating highly unique and unusual results.</p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/adobe-photoshop-express/id331975235?mt=8" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.psmobile" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="3-VSCO"><a href="#3-VSCO" class="headerlink" title="3.

It can be used as a camera app as well as an Instagram photo editor app, meaning you can take better images in the first place as well as refine those you’ve already taken.</p><p>We like it because it’s simple. User friendly sliders help you adjust the lighting, sharpness, saturation and temperature as well as tinting and adding vignette effects to the photo. It’s available on both iOS and Android, free with all the basic tools and filters, although you can buy additional photo filter packs in the store.</p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/vsco/id588013838?mt=8" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vsco.cam" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="4-Pixlr"><a href="#4-Pixlr" class="headerlink" title="4.

Although certainly very useful to those of us who didn’t want to pay for editing software, when the company was bought out by Autodesk in 2011, they finally brought the intuitive functionality of Pixlr to our smartphones too.</p><p>You can do pretty much everything you want with this sweet little Instagram photo editor app. Blur, sharpen, collage, add text, resize… you can even make your photo look like an ink drawing or a pencil sketch. With so many options, it can take a while to master, but there are numerous video tutorials online for support.</p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixlr-photo-collages-effect/id526783584?mt=8" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pixlr.express" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="5-Facetune"><a href="#5-Facetune" class="headerlink" title="5.

Although rather controversial, the editing available from this little app is truly out of this world, with nothing else in the market quite matching it for selfie tuning. It costs $3.99 to download, but there are no more purchases to make once you’ve bought the software.</p><p>From a standard portrait, you can add make up, reduce wrinkles, sweep highlight over your cheeks or make your eyelashes look fuller. Enhance your cheekbones, straighten your nose, fill in patchy eyebrows and get an instant tooth whitening treatment… there’s really not much that this can’t improve on a face. If Instagram selfies are your thing, this is one to have a play with.</p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/facetune/id606310581?mt=8" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lightricks.facetune" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>There are many more Instagram photo editor app choices out there, so do take a look around and see what suits your needs the best. Do watch out for ‘free’ editing apps which have a rapidly approaching paywall; these we have mentioned here are perfectly functional without additional payment, but there are others which may not be as free as they first seem.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1374820">                    <video width="200" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1374820.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1374820">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1374820.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1374820%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1374820/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Instagram-photo-editor-online"><a href="#Instagram-photo-editor-online" class="headerlink" title="Instagram photo editor online"></a>Instagram photo editor online</h3><p>If you prefer to use your PC to edit your photos, then there are plenty of options in the online world too. Here are five of the best Instagram photo editor options from the web.</p><h4 id="1-Canva"><a href="#1-Canva" class="headerlink" title="1. Canva"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://www.canva.com/" >Canva <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>If you haven’t come across Canva yet, it’s absolutely a tool to investigate if you love beautiful Instagram images. Choose their ‘social graphic 800 x 800px’ template for the perfect Instagram image size and upload your own photo to the editor with a click.</p><p>Once uploaded, you can add wording, filters and more to perfect your image. We love the funky fonts and word layouts, which are perfect for creating those shareable quotes and inspirational memes for your followers to enjoy. The software is free online, and although you do have to pay for some of the images and fonts, there’s plenty to do without paying a penny.</p><h4 id="2-Wondershare-PixStudio"><a href="#2-Wondershare-PixStudio" class="headerlink" title="2. Wondershare PixStudio"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/" >Wondershare PixStudio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Wondershare PixStudio is an all-in-one and powerful online graphic design maker for everyone. It has various types of templates for YouTube Thumbnails, Logos, Posters, etc. You can create a beautiful design by simply dragging and dropping the elements and photos. The online platform is free to use all templates, just One-Click to download your creations and share to your Facebook, Instagram Story, and YouTube Thumbnails, etc. immediately.</p><p>PixStudio has special features to remove the image background. With a single click, you can quickly remove the image background, and use your image with more flexibility. Just payment of $7.99 per month to use the features.</p><h4 id="3-Fotor"><a href="#3-Fotor" class="headerlink" title="3. Fotor"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://www.fotor.com/" >Fotor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Another free-to-use online Instagram photo editor is Fotor. It’s absolutely packed with tools and functions to prepare your images ready for sharing. It comes with filters of its own, many of which are not available on Instagram, as well as templates for adding text to your image.</p><p>The software works in layers, which can be a huge advantage if you’d like to add more to your picture. It also means you can work on various parts of the image without risking affecting any of the other layers, helping you to avoid non-undoable mistakes that simply ruin a morning’s work. As with Canva, there are some paid options, but enough to keep you busy without opening for wallet for sure.</p><h4 id="4-Pixlr-Editor"><a href="#4-Pixlr-Editor" class="headerlink" title="4. Pixlr Editor"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://pixlr.com/editor/" >Pixlr Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>If you’ve tried the Pixlr Express app and love it, why not step your game up a bit with the fully fledged Pixlr Editor. It’s a hairs breadth away from having full Photoshop functionality, but hallelujah it’s free!</p><p>It’s got layers, masks, clone stamps, lasso selection tools, and much, much more. If you’ve never used a pro photo editing suite before it might take a bit of getting used to, but it’s far and away the most powerful Instagram photo editor on the web. The only downside is that it’s fully Flash based, so access via a tablet is out.</p><h4 id="5-piZap"><a href="#5-piZap" class="headerlink" title="5. piZap"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.pizap.com/" >piZap <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>For those looking for a simpler, less fussy Instagram photo editor, piZap might be just what you need. It’s created solely for social sharing, and makes it easy to import photos from Facebook, Google Photos or wherever to work on with the editor.</p><p>Unlike Pixlr Editor, piZap works in both HTML5 and Flash, so you can use it whatever device you happen to be using.

The image should be you as the subject and the location as the background.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/travel-instagram-video-template.gif"                      alt="travel instagram video template"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087484/7443" target="_top" id="2087484">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087484" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087484/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Admittedly, this Instagram video template is simple.

The app has made it huge in the social media game, with roughly 1 billion official app users and 500 million daily active users of IG stories. By just creating an Instagram account, people may share videos directly from their cell phones. However, because Instagram allows for varied video lengths, figuring out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to post videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be difficult. There is a specific time limit for each video genre. All of those video forms, including Instagram feed and story videos, IG Live and IGTV, Instagram reels, and ad videos, will be covered in this article.</p><p>We’ll start by discussing what we mean by “Instagram video.” Instagram video encompasses the Instagram feed, Instagram Stories, Instagram Live, and Instagram advertisements, among other things. Instagram continues to expand at a rapid pace as more consumers and organizations migrate to mobile. Businesses are flocking to Instagram since it has shown to be successful. That’s not all, though as millions of businesses join Instagram, the chances of you running into competition increase. Businesses need to have a presence on Facebook because their customers expect it and search for them there, and the same is true of Instagram.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Tutorial for How to Record on GarageBand</a></p><h2 id="How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be"><a href="#How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be" class="headerlink" title="How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?"></a>How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</h2><p>Instagram feed videos, Instagram Story videos, IGTV videos, Instagram advertising, and Instagram Live have various length limitations. We’ve broken down Instagram video length details for each of them in this guide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-1.png"                      alt="instagram video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Story-Video"><a href="#Instagram-Story-Video" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Story Video"></a>Instagram Story Video</h4><p>Instagram Stories are full-screen, vertical photographs and videos that vanish after 24 hours. Rather than appearing in the news feed, they appear at the top of the Instagram app. To make your material stand out, they use interactive features like stickers, polls, and Instagram Story filters.</p><p>Each Instagram Story has a length of 15-second time limit. If you upload a video that is longer than 15 seconds, they will automatically cut it into 15-second segments. However, based on testing, it appears that you’ll only receive four 15-second parts. Thus, this is only suitable for recordings under one minute.</p><p>Furthermore, to use the new feature and make lengthier Instagram Stories, simply tap the Your Story symbol and then press and hold the record button in the bottom-right corner for as long as you want to record a moment - without worrying about the 15-second limit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-2.png"                      alt="instgarm story video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Reels"></a>Instagram Reels</h4><p>Instagram’s newest feature is Reels. It also allows you to share small video snippets (up to 15 seconds in length) with all Instagram users. Before publishing your Reel, you can dub audio, tweak footage, and add instant effects. The Reel video will then appear in your followers’ feeds.</p><p>Instagram Reels length is now limited to 60 seconds in duration. Previously, the maximum length was 30 seconds, however owing to competition from TikTok, Instagram decided to raise it. TikTok, one of the platform’s main competitors, recently increased the video length limit to three minutes.</p><p>To use this feature, go to Create a New Reel and then press the left-hand down button to see the menu. To construct a reel, tap “length” to choose between settings.</p><h4 id="IGTV-Video-On-Instagram"><a href="#IGTV-Video-On-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="IGTV Video On Instagram"></a>IGTV Video On Instagram</h4><p>Creators can upload high-quality, long-form, vertical videos to Instagram TV, also known as IGTV. Users may use IGTV to generate more engaging content for their audiences. Because social media is all about sharing interesting content, IGTV is worth looking into.</p><p>Instagram’s IGTV section allows users to upload and view longer videos. IGTV videos length is of 15 minutes long on the Instagram mobile app and up to an hour-long on the Instagram website. And because these films are posts, they won’t vanish after a day as Stories do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-3.png"                      alt="IGTV video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video"></a>IG Feed Video</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>Videos can only be 1 minute or 60 seconds long when posted to the Instagram feed. In addition, if you wish to submit a video to your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts utilizing the app’s built-in editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-4.png"                      alt="IG Feed video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-Ads"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-Ads" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video Ads"></a>IG Feed Video Ads</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>If you want to share a video on your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts using the app’s built-in editor. You can then post it immediately to your profile. To do so, go to your profile and click the ‘+’ icon. Choose the video you wish to share and then click ‘next.’ That concludes the discussion. You can now share the movie on your social media accounts with an interesting caption.</p><h4 id="IG-Story-Video-Ads"><a href="#IG-Story-Video-Ads" class="headerlink" title="IG Story Video Ads"></a>IG Story Video Ads</h4><p>Instagram Stories advertisements are an excellent method to reach out to new people while also showcasing your brand, company, and products to an already engaged audience. Instagram Stories already have excellent engagement rates, with one out of every five stories receiving a direct reply from viewers.</p><p>The maximum length of an Instagram Story video ad is two minutes. You can utilize different story cards if you want to show your ad on an Instagram story. Each card can display a 15-second video or a single 5-second picture ad.

Only the first three cards of a complete ad will appear in the Instagram story stream. After that, after touching on the ad, the viewer must choose whether or not to see more.</p><p>Furthermore, Instagram Stories will show 15-second or shorter video advertising for the duration of the video.

The app has made it huge in the social media game, with roughly 1 billion official app users and 500 million daily active users of IG stories. By just creating an Instagram account, people may share videos directly from their cell phones. However, because Instagram allows for varied video lengths, figuring out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to post videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be difficult. There is a specific time limit for each video genre. All of those video forms, including Instagram feed and story videos, IG Live and IGTV, Instagram reels, and ad videos, will be covered in this article.</p><p>We’ll start by discussing what we mean by “Instagram video.” Instagram video encompasses the Instagram feed, Instagram Stories, Instagram Live, and Instagram advertisements, among other things. Instagram continues to expand at a rapid pace as more consumers and organizations migrate to mobile. Businesses are flocking to Instagram since it has shown to be successful. That’s not all, though as millions of businesses join Instagram, the chances of you running into competition increase. Businesses need to have a presence on Facebook because their customers expect it and search for them there, and the same is true of Instagram.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Tutorial for How to Record on GarageBand</a></p><h2 id="How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be-3"><a href="#How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be-3" class="headerlink" title="How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?"></a>How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</h2><p>Instagram feed videos, Instagram Story videos, IGTV videos, Instagram advertising, and Instagram Live have various length limitations.

Rather than appearing in the news feed, they appear at the top of the Instagram app. To make your material stand out, they use interactive features like stickers, polls, and Instagram Story filters.</p><p>Each Instagram Story has a length of 15-second time limit. If you upload a video that is longer than 15 seconds, they will automatically cut it into 15-second segments. However, based on testing, it appears that you’ll only receive four 15-second parts. Thus, this is only suitable for recordings under one minute.</p><p>Furthermore, to use the new feature and make lengthier Instagram Stories, simply tap the Your Story symbol and then press and hold the record button in the bottom-right corner for as long as you want to record a moment - without worrying about the 15-second limit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-2.png"                      alt="instgarm story video length"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087262/19272" target="_top" id="2087262">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087262" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087262/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="Instagram-Reels-3"><a href="#Instagram-Reels-3" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Reels"></a>Instagram Reels</h4><p>Instagram’s newest feature is Reels. It also allows you to share small video snippets (up to 15 seconds in length) with all Instagram users. Before publishing your Reel, you can dub audio, tweak footage, and add instant effects. The Reel video will then appear in your followers’ feeds.</p><p>Instagram Reels length is now limited to 60 seconds in duration. Previously, the maximum length was 30 seconds, however owing to competition from TikTok, Instagram decided to raise it. TikTok, one of the platform’s main competitors, recently increased the video length limit to three minutes.</p><p>To use this feature, go to Create a New Reel and then press the left-hand down button to see the menu. To construct a reel, tap “length” to choose between settings.</p><h4 id="IGTV-Video-On-Instagram-3"><a href="#IGTV-Video-On-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="IGTV Video On Instagram"></a>IGTV Video On Instagram</h4><p>Creators can upload high-quality, long-form, vertical videos to Instagram TV, also known as IGTV. Users may use IGTV to generate more engaging content for their audiences. Because social media is all about sharing interesting content, IGTV is worth looking into.</p><p>Instagram’s IGTV section allows users to upload and view longer videos. IGTV videos length is of 15 minutes long on the Instagram mobile app and up to an hour-long on the Instagram website. And because these films are posts, they won’t vanish after a day as Stories do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-3.png"                      alt="IGTV video length"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137211/26400" target="_top" id="2137211">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137211" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137211/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-3"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video"></a>IG Feed Video</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos.

In addition, if you wish to submit a video to your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed.

Even if you find the engagement rate satisfying, check out if the comments and likes are real or purchased.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135415/19272" target="_top" id="2135415">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135415" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135415/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Using-Third-Party-Tools"><a href="#4-Using-Third-Party-Tools" class="headerlink" title="4.

Even though it’s a great feature and very beneficial for the users to choose among the variety, it can be annoying to skim through the long list to find a specific filter. For that sole reason, Instagram provides the user with the option to hide certain filters or rearrange them to find a filter of your preference easily.</p><p>The steps below are a guide to organizing the filters for your Instagram Post&#x2F;Reels&#x2F;Feed.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Tap on Manage Option</strong></p><p>The initial step is to select or capture a photo&#x2F;video. Go to the filters screen and scroll to the end of the list to tap on the <strong>Manage</strong> option. It is a settings option specifically for the filters feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-filter-manage.jpg"                      alt="ins  filters manage"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Rearrange or Hide Filters</strong></p><p>For rearranging your filters, hold and drag the three lines on the left side of the specified filter to wherever you want it to be. As for hiding a specific filter, tap on the circle present at the right side of the filter. When the tick sign disappears and the color of the title of the filter fades, it means that the filter has been hidden.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Another way to rearrange or hide filters is to do it from the filters screen. Long press on the specified filter and drag it to the position you want it to be. And drop the filter on the <strong>Drag to hide</strong> option to hide the selected filter. You can always turn off this feature from the manage menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/arrange-hide-instagram-filters.jpg"                      alt="arrange ins  filters"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Tap Done</strong></p><p>Once you have made the required adjustments, tap on the <strong>Done</strong> option present at the top right corner of the screen. And you are done rearranging the filters!</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>For many individuals, using Instagram might not be as easy as it is for the new generation.

They are a great way to categorize and eternalize your stories on the feed for your audience to enjoy repeatedly. <strong>Creating Instagram highlight covers</strong> is a great way to build your brand and make your profile stand out. Moreover, you can customize your highlight covers with patterns, colors, and graphics to add to the overall aesthetic.

Thus, it is vital to have the correct size and dimensions. Creating highlight covers with proper width and height ensures that you do not have to crop any of your designs.</p><p>Generally, the Instagram highlight covers dimensions are the same as Insta stories, that is, 1080 pixels by 1920 pixels or a 9:16 aspect ratio. We recommend using square 1:1 dimensions when designing your custom highlight covers with high pixels as they work well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-instagram-highlight.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Instagram highlight "                ></p><p>When designing custom highlight covers on Canva, you will notice that the icon will be in the middle of a story-size rectangle. The overall aspect ratio to make highlight covers in Canva is 9:16.

So, make the best use of it by creating custom highlight covers.</p><p>There are many photo editors you can use for Instagram highlight cover and creating great-looking Instagram highlight covers is super easy with the free online tool Canva.</p><p>Here is a step-by-step guide to follow on how to make highlight covers using the tool</p><p><strong>Step 1: Head over to canva.com or download the Canva App</strong></p><p>Once you are on the website, create your free account if you do not have one, and then log into your account.

Here is another bonus section regarding tips on vertical videos for Instagram in addition to the video specs.

To make it a hassle-free task so that you can share the video on multiple platforms like Facebook and YouTube, you can turn your camera upright on your smartphone and shoot the vertical footage for the best results. Doing so will let you complete control over the screen to fill the whole frame for a better viewing experience. If on camera, you can rotate it to 90 degrees.</p><p><strong>Tip 2: Post-produce edit from horizontal to vertical</strong></p><p>Is the video already shot horizontally on your camera or smartphone? No worries, as you can edit them to the desired aspect ratio from 16:9 to 9:16 with the assistance of software like iMovie, Final Cut Pro X, and other third-party applications like <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong></a>. This tactic’s only challenge is that you need to be ready to crop the left and right sides of the shot or recorded video, and do not forget that the concept needs to be centralized!</p><p><strong>Tip 3: Crop to reveal details</strong></p><p>Vertical video is a great option to showcase wide and tall subjects where you can place close-ups and show off details to get up close and personal. It could be a product or fabric.

Today Instagram stories have become more popular than the OG Snapchat. Instagram stories are a great feature to share your journey with your followers. However, the stories are temporary and only last for 24 hours. You can view the stories of your followers in your feed but you can also check the stories of people you are not following on the discover feed. The person who posted the story can see who has seen the story through Instagram story viewer.</p><p>To find out more about IG story viewer and how it works, continue reading this article.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">1.

How Does Instagram Organize the Story Views?"></a>1. How Does Instagram Organize the Story Views?</h2><p>Over just a decade ago, Instagram has grown to become one of the most popular social media platforms with over 1 billion active users worldwide. Instagram is constantly evolving and introducing intriguing updates, intuitive design, and crazy monetization features. What started as a picture editing and sharing app, has now become a crazy online business tool. Celebrities, influencers, entrepreneurs and multi-billion corporations are all using Instagram to directly engage with their target audience and get new customers.</p><p>With millions of people using the app every day, Instagram has to constantly upgrade its algorithm to maintain transparency – so, cheats, no shortcuts, and no hacks! Instagram algorithms are based on engagement, hashtags, shout-outs, and other factors. However, engagement elements like comments, likes, saves, and views determine most content that will appear on the feed.</p><p>Instagram uses the same algorithm to organize the story feeds as well. Thus, how you engage and connect with your followers and audience will determine, how Instagram organizes the placement of your story and your story views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-instagram-story-viewer.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer"                ></p><h2 id="2-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-List"><a href="#2-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-List" class="headerlink" title="2. The Instagram Story Viewer List?"></a>2. The Instagram Story Viewer List?</h2><p>Instagram has two feeds, a vertical feed, and a horizontal feed. The vertical feed shows shared posts like an image, boomerang or reel. And, the vertical feed at the top of the page is the story feed. The story feed presents the micro user content. These are 15-second-long videos that appear for instant interaction with the followers. Instagram uses advanced algorithms to organize the feed and views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-instagram-story-viewer-list.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer-list"                ></p><p>Each story that people see generates views. These views are arranged in a story viewer list. Instagram story viewers list is the one that contains all your story views. To access this list:</p><ul><li>Open your Instagram app and tap on your profile picture at the top of your feed</li><li>If you have put up story there, look at the lower-left corner of the picture&#x2F;boomerang&#x2F;video</li><li>Here the people who viewed your stories will appear under the tag “Seen by #” (The “Seen by #” label will show how who and how many of among your followers have seen your story)</li><li>Tap on Seen by # to open the story viewers list</li></ul><h2 id="3-What’s-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-Order"><a href="#3-What’s-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-Order" class="headerlink" title="3. What’s The Instagram Story Viewer Order?"></a>3. What’s The Instagram Story Viewer Order?</h2><p>Previously Instagram story views were arranged in chronological order. However, in 2021 the story views are organized based on engagement. The new Instagram algorithm shows the accounts you engage with the most at the top of your story views list.</p><p>Similarly, the more engagement you have with the follower the more chances are of that follower to be at the top of the views list. These accounts are those that give you the most likes, comments, DMs, profile visits, saves etc. But this algorithm only works for those who get more than 50 views. If your story gets under 50 views then the list is sequential meaning that the one who watches your stories first will show up at the top of the list.</p><h2 id="4-How-Does-Instagram-Sorts-Instagram-Story-Viewers"><a href="#4-How-Does-Instagram-Sorts-Instagram-Story-Viewers" class="headerlink" title="4. How Does Instagram Sorts Instagram Story Viewers?"></a>4. How Does Instagram Sorts Instagram Story Viewers?</h2><p>Instagram sorts story views through an algorithm that is based on total profile visits, comments, likes and other interactive elements. Based on the data from these factors, Instagram ranks the reviewers of a story. As stated earlier the accounts users interact with the most will appear first in their story feed.</p><p>So, the key is to make your followers engage and interact with you. A lot of people have tried to crack the algorithm, but Instagram has kept it a secret so no one can manipulate it. This maintains transparency and tough competition among users. A useful tip is to use location sticker on story because viewers also view stories by location so using location hashtag in story can also prove to be effective.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-instagram-story-viewer-algorithm.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer-algorithm"                ></p><h2 id="5-Is-It-Anonymous-When-Viewing-One’s-Instagram-Story"><a href="#5-Is-It-Anonymous-When-Viewing-One’s-Instagram-Story" class="headerlink" title="5. Is It Anonymous When Viewing One’s Instagram Story?"></a>5. Is It Anonymous When Viewing One’s Instagram Story?</h2><p>In simple words no you cannot view your following’s Instagram stories anonymously from the Instagram app. Whichever account you use to view the story it will appear in in the story viewers list of the person who posted the story. A lot of people do use third-party apps to anonymously access Instagram stories. Other also create fake accounts to conceal their real identity.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1884017/19272" target="_top" id="1884017">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1884017" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1884017/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-How-Can-I-Know-If-Someone-Viewed-My-Instagram-Stories"><a href="#6-How-Can-I-Know-If-Someone-Viewed-My-Instagram-Stories" class="headerlink" title="6.

So, if you want to know <strong>how to save reels with music</strong> on your device, here are the steps you need to follow:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Instagram account and click on your profile picture. When the page appears where you can add a Post, Story, or Reel, you need to click on the top left gear icon, which is the Camera Settings icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-camera-settings-option.jpg"                      alt="instagram reels camera settings"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The Camera Settings will show you three things, Story, Reels, Live.

You can pick any song that you like and add it as a background sound. However, when it comes to business accounts, there is a restriction. Business accounts can’t add any recording artists’ music to their reels. That’s due to some copyright issues. But, if you have original music, you can add that to your Reel. The key is to search for a song with the words “Original Music.”</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Instagram Reels are beneficial for everyone. Whether you are an influencer, celebrity, brand, or someone who likes to have fun using Instagram, Reels are suitable for everyone. It lets you create a short video that enables you to engage with your followers.
