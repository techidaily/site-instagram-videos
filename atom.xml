It’s a platform where you can share your photos and let everyone know what you recently ate, went to, and so on. However, the same platform can turn out to be quite dangerous when someone targets you for trolling and harassment, and this is where the blocking feature comes in handy. So, if you want to learn <strong>how to block someone on Instagram,</strong> you have come to the right place.

Another thing is that the person that you will block won’t be notified about it. There are two ways to do that. One is through your Instagram app, and the second is through the web browser.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><h3 id="Method-1-Using-Your-Instagram-Mobile-App-to-Block-Followers"><a href="#Method-1-Using-Your-Instagram-Mobile-App-to-Block-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Using Your Instagram Mobile App to Block Followers"></a>Method 1: Using Your Instagram Mobile App to Block Followers</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Take your smartphone, Android or iPhone, whatever you are using, and find the Instagram app. Once you find it, open it and locate the person that you want to block.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to their account, now click on the three dots you see on the top right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/visit-the-profile-and-click-on-the-three-dots.jpg"                      alt="Visit  Instagram Profile"                ></p><p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>3</strong> <strong>:</strong> Click on that, and you will see a small pop-up with multiple choices; you need to click on the block option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/click-on-instagram-block-option.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Block options"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Instagram will ask you if you want to block the person; click on the block option again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/confirm-instagram-block.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Block  "                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Using-a-Web-Browser-to-Block-Followers"><a href="#Method-2-Using-a-Web-Browser-to-Block-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using a Web Browser to Block Followers"></a>Method 2: Using a Web Browser to Block Followers</h3><p>If you don’t want to use your mobile app, you can easily block a person using the web browser.

Instagram has a dedicated tab where you can see the blocked account. To be able to see that, follow these steps. These steps will remain the same for Android and iPhone devices.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Take your Android or iPhone device and open the Instagram app.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Log in to your account if you aren’t logged in yet. Once you are there, you will see three bars or dots on the right side of your profile. Please tap on that.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You will see a host of options.

Let’s make it simpler. You have blocked someone recently, but you didn’t know that the same person has also done the same thing. Now that you have been blocked when you try to unblock their account, you won’t see it because that’s how blocked accounts work. You will not see the person’s account; their messages will be deleted, every like and comment shared on your profile will be removed too.</p><p>So, when the other person blocks a user, their account vanishes and doesn’t appear in the blocked list. Even if you try to find their profile by entering their handle on the search bar, you will see the notification “user not found.” And this is why you can’t unblock that person. Both of you have blocked each other.</p><h2 id="FAQs-About-Instagram-Block-2"><a href="#FAQs-About-Instagram-Block-2" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Instagram Block"></a>FAQs About Instagram Block</h2><ol><li><strong>How to see who blocked you on Instagram?</strong></li></ol><p>Instagram doesn’t offer you any direct way to know who has blocked you. However, if you have suddenly stopped seeing the posts and stories of a person you have been following, you can search for the person’s account. If no account pops up, it could mean that this person has blocked you. Also, if you can navigate to their account, however, can’t see anything, such as their profile picture, posts, and stories, that’s a clear indication that you have been blocked. So, there’s no direct way, and the only thing you can do is search for that person.</p><ol><li><strong>What happens when you block someone on Instagram?</strong></li></ol><p>Once you block a person on Instagram, they will no longer appear in your followers’ list. They will no longer be able to track your account, see your profile picture, posts, and stories. Also, the person won’t be notified that you have blocked them.</p><ol><li><strong>Does blocking people on Instagram delete your messages?</strong></li></ol><p>No, Instagram doesn’t delete the messages from your inbox, but what it does is make the chat thread inactive. This means the messages won’t show!</p><ol><li><strong>When you block someone, do their likes disappear?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, both their likes and comments will disappear once you block someone.</p><ol><li><strong>What does it look like when someone blocks you on Instagram?</strong></li></ol><p>When someone blocks you, and you try to find that user, you will be shown this user is not available message instead of their profile.

Please click on that.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> This is the page where you will see the list of accounts that you have blocked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-find-blocked-accounts.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Block  account"                ></p><hr><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Unblock-Someone-on-Instagram-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Unblock-Someone-on-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Unblock Someone on Instagram?"></a>Part 4: How to Unblock Someone on Instagram?</h2><p>Just like blocking an account is possible, unblocking the same account is possible as well. Yet again, you can unblock someone using your Instagram app on your mobile phone; else, you can use any web browser and do the needful. Readers must note that when you unblock someone, the unlocked user won’t know about it, but if they search you, they will be able to locate it. And if you don’t keep your account private, they will be able to see all the posts and stories you share. To learn <strong>how to unblock people on Instagram,</strong> follow these simple steps.</p><h3 id="For-Instagram-app-3"><a href="#For-Instagram-app-3" class="headerlink" title="For Instagram app"></a>For Instagram app</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Instagram on your Android device or iPhone, and log in to your account if you are not. Your profile will appear first. On your profile, you will see three dots or lines; that’s the hamburger icon. Please click on that.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once you do, you will see multiple options. From the list, you need to click on the Settings option. You will see the privacy option; please tap on that.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Under the Privacy tab, you will see some sub-tabs, and one of them will be blocked accounts. You need to hit the blocked accounts option.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You will see all the accounts that you have blocked. Click on the account that you want to unblock, and click on the unblock option that you see towards the right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unblock-instagram-blocked-accounts.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Unblock  "                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Instagram will ask you to confirm your choice. You need to click on the Unblock option again. That’s it; the user has been unblocked successfully.</p><h3 id="Unblocking-Instagram-User-from-Web-Browsers-3"><a href="#Unblocking-Instagram-User-from-Web-Browsers-3" class="headerlink" title="Unblocking Instagram User from Web Browsers"></a>Unblocking Instagram User from Web Browsers</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch a web browser and visit Instagram, and you will have to log in to your account if you aren’t logged in. Use your credentials and log in.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> On the search bar, which will be there on the home page and not on the profile page, you need to find the person you want to unlock.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Visit their profile, and you will see the unblock option. Click on the unblock option to remove the profile from the blocked list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unblock-instagram-users-web.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Unblock from web  "                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click on the unblock option, and Instagram will ask you to confirm your choice. Click on the unblock option again, and it’s done.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Why-Can’t-I-Unblock-a-Person-on-Instagram-3"><a href="#Part-5-Why-Can’t-I-Unblock-a-Person-on-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Why Can’t I Unblock a Person on Instagram?"></a>Part 5: Why Can’t I Unblock a Person on Instagram?</h2><p>If the two-way block has been implemented, then unblocking the same person will become problematic. Let’s make it simpler. You have blocked someone recently, but you didn’t know that the same person has also done the same thing. Now that you have been blocked when you try to unblock their account, you won’t see it because that’s how blocked accounts work. You will not see the person’s account; their messages will be deleted, every like and comment shared on your profile will be removed too.</p><p>So, when the other person blocks a user, their account vanishes and doesn’t appear in the blocked list. Even if you try to find their profile by entering their handle on the search bar, you will see the notification “user not found.” And this is why you can’t unblock that person. Both of you have blocked each other.</p><h2 id="FAQs-About-Instagram-Block-3"><a href="#FAQs-About-Instagram-Block-3" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Instagram Block"></a>FAQs About Instagram Block</h2><ol><li><strong>How to see who blocked you on Instagram?</strong></li></ol><p>Instagram doesn’t offer you any direct way to know who has blocked you. However, if you have suddenly stopped seeing the posts and stories of a person you have been following, you can search for the person’s account. If no account pops up, it could mean that this person has blocked you. Also, if you can navigate to their account, however, can’t see anything, such as their profile picture, posts, and stories, that’s a clear indication that you have been blocked. So, there’s no direct way, and the only thing you can do is search for that person.</p><ol><li><strong>What happens when you block someone on Instagram?</strong></li></ol><p>Once you block a person on Instagram, they will no longer appear in your followers’ list. They will no longer be able to track your account, see your profile picture, posts, and stories. Also, the person won’t be notified that you have blocked them.</p><ol><li><strong>Does blocking people on Instagram delete your messages?</strong></li></ol><p>No, Instagram doesn’t delete the messages from your inbox, but what it does is make the chat thread inactive. This means the messages won’t show!</p><ol><li><strong>When you block someone, do their likes disappear?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, both their likes and comments will disappear once you block someone.</p><ol><li><strong>What does it look like when someone blocks you on Instagram?</strong></li></ol><p>When someone blocks you, and you try to find that user, you will be shown this user is not available message instead of their profile. There won’t be any profile photo, and it would appear as if the person is no longer using Instagram.</p><ol><li><strong>When you unblock someone on Instagram, will they know?</strong></li></ol><p>No, Instagram allows you to block people remotely and won’t send any notifications. Even if you unlock them, they won’t know about it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

The good news is that you don’t have to keep searching for the Music section for the trending track. Instagram ensures to make adding Music as a background sound easy. Follow the steps that we have written below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Reel whose background music you like, and you will see the name of the song right at the bottom. You need to click on that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-background-music.jpg"                      alt="instagram reels background music"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After clicking on the song name, you find other Reels who have used the same track. Along with it, you will also see the Use Audio option. Please tap on that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-use-audio-option.jpg"                      alt="instagram reels use audio from others"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The moment you tap on the Use Audio option, you will be taken to your Reel recording page.

All you will have to do is use any of the music apps on your phone with your Instagram account. Then, play your favorite song, and while doing that, start recording a reel. The music that is being played will be added to the Reel.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Add-Your-Own-Voice-to-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Add-Your-Own-Voice-to-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Add Your Own Voice to Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 5: How to Add Your Own Voice to Instagram Reels?</h2><p>If you don’t want to add music as your background sound, instead use your voice as a voiceover; Instagram has the voiceover feature that will let you do that. However, you can apply this feature only after finishing your recording.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your Instagram account and click on your profile to start recording for your Reel. And then record the video as usual for the Reel.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If you want to add music, you can do that; if not, just let it be. After the recording is done, you will be taken to another page. Here, you will see some option right at the top of the recorded video. Click on the Microphone icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-microphone-option.jpg"                      alt="instagram reels microphone option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, start recording your voice.

The app has made it huge in the social media game, with roughly 1 billion official app users and 500 million daily active users of IG stories. By just creating an Instagram account, people may share videos directly from their cell phones. However, because Instagram allows for varied video lengths, figuring out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to post videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be difficult. There is a specific time limit for each video genre. All of those video forms, including Instagram feed and story videos, IG Live and IGTV, Instagram reels, and ad videos, will be covered in this article.</p><p>We’ll start by discussing what we mean by “Instagram video.” Instagram video encompasses the Instagram feed, Instagram Stories, Instagram Live, and Instagram advertisements, among other things. Instagram continues to expand at a rapid pace as more consumers and organizations migrate to mobile. Businesses are flocking to Instagram since it has shown to be successful. That’s not all, though as millions of businesses join Instagram, the chances of you running into competition increase. Businesses need to have a presence on Facebook because their customers expect it and search for them there, and the same is true of Instagram.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Tutorial for How to Record on GarageBand</a></p><h2 id="How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be"><a href="#How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be" class="headerlink" title="How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?"></a>How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</h2><p>Instagram feed videos, Instagram Story videos, IGTV videos, Instagram advertising, and Instagram Live have various length limitations. We’ve broken down Instagram video length details for each of them in this guide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-1.png"                      alt="instagram video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Story-Video"><a href="#Instagram-Story-Video" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Story Video"></a>Instagram Story Video</h4><p>Instagram Stories are full-screen, vertical photographs and videos that vanish after 24 hours. Rather than appearing in the news feed, they appear at the top of the Instagram app. To make your material stand out, they use interactive features like stickers, polls, and Instagram Story filters.</p><p>Each Instagram Story has a length of 15-second time limit. If you upload a video that is longer than 15 seconds, they will automatically cut it into 15-second segments. However, based on testing, it appears that you’ll only receive four 15-second parts. Thus, this is only suitable for recordings under one minute.</p><p>Furthermore, to use the new feature and make lengthier Instagram Stories, simply tap the Your Story symbol and then press and hold the record button in the bottom-right corner for as long as you want to record a moment - without worrying about the 15-second limit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-2.png"                      alt="instgarm story video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Reels"></a>Instagram Reels</h4><p>Instagram’s newest feature is Reels. It also allows you to share small video snippets (up to 15 seconds in length) with all Instagram users. Before publishing your Reel, you can dub audio, tweak footage, and add instant effects. The Reel video will then appear in your followers’ feeds.</p><p>Instagram Reels length is now limited to 60 seconds in duration. Previously, the maximum length was 30 seconds, however owing to competition from TikTok, Instagram decided to raise it. TikTok, one of the platform’s main competitors, recently increased the video length limit to three minutes.</p><p>To use this feature, go to Create a New Reel and then press the left-hand down button to see the menu. To construct a reel, tap “length” to choose between settings.</p><h4 id="IGTV-Video-On-Instagram"><a href="#IGTV-Video-On-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="IGTV Video On Instagram"></a>IGTV Video On Instagram</h4><p>Creators can upload high-quality, long-form, vertical videos to Instagram TV, also known as IGTV. Users may use IGTV to generate more engaging content for their audiences. Because social media is all about sharing interesting content, IGTV is worth looking into.</p><p>Instagram’s IGTV section allows users to upload and view longer videos. IGTV videos length is of 15 minutes long on the Instagram mobile app and up to an hour-long on the Instagram website. And because these films are posts, they won’t vanish after a day as Stories do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-3.png"                      alt="IGTV video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video"></a>IG Feed Video</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>Videos can only be 1 minute or 60 seconds long when posted to the Instagram feed. In addition, if you wish to submit a video to your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts utilizing the app’s built-in editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-4.png"                      alt="IG Feed video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-Ads"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-Ads" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video Ads"></a>IG Feed Video Ads</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>If you want to share a video on your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts using the app’s built-in editor. You can then post it immediately to your profile. To do so, go to your profile and click the ‘+’ icon. Choose the video you wish to share and then click ‘next.’ That concludes the discussion. You can now share the movie on your social media accounts with an interesting caption.</p><h4 id="IG-Story-Video-Ads"><a href="#IG-Story-Video-Ads" class="headerlink" title="IG Story Video Ads"></a>IG Story Video Ads</h4><p>Instagram Stories advertisements are an excellent method to reach out to new people while also showcasing your brand, company, and products to an already engaged audience. Instagram Stories already have excellent engagement rates, with one out of every five stories receiving a direct reply from viewers.</p><p>The maximum length of an Instagram Story video ad is two minutes. You can utilize different story cards if you want to show your ad on an Instagram story. Each card can display a 15-second video or a single 5-second picture ad. Only the first three cards of a complete ad will appear in the Instagram story stream. After that, after touching on the ad, the viewer must choose whether or not to see more.</p><p>Furthermore, Instagram Stories will show 15-second or shorter video advertising for the duration of the video. Video ads lasting more than 10 seconds will be broken into different Stories cards.</p><h2 id="How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram"><a href="#How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?"></a>How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</h2><p>You must be thinking about how to upload flawlessly every time with all of these time limits and video publication options. Here are some helpful hints:</p><ul><li>If you’re worried your IG Feed video is too long and don’t want to edit it, make a video carousel post by breaking it up into smaller chunks. By swiping the post, the viewer will be able to see everything.</li><li>If you felt pressed to stay inside the time limit and made a video that was far too short, you can add more footage, slow it down, or add a loop. Another option is to use a video editor to make an intro and an end screen.</li><li>If your Instagram story is too long, you can cut it down using any Instagram video editor. Record the video, then open it in your app to edit and trim it down before selecting the clips to upload the full story.</li><li>In addition, if your Instagram ad video is longer than 15 seconds, Instagram provides 10 cards, each with a 15-second video duration limit. This will allow you to show your complete advertisement without compressing it.</li><li>The four-hour limit seems insufficient if you wish to have a more extended live stream on Instagram. Then, as soon as you reach the time restriction, you can easily go live again and re-start the stream as many times as you wish.</li><li>To make videos that will receive hundreds of likes on Instagram, you’ll need video editing software that allows you to change the aspect ratio of the videos you wish to submit. Wondershare Filmora is a video editing program that supports a wide range of video file formats and allows you to crop and prepare your videos for web use.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> That’s all there is to know about the length of Instagram videos.

By swiping the post, the viewer will be able to see everything.</li><li>If you felt pressed to stay inside the time limit and made a video that was far too short, you can add more footage, slow it down, or add a loop. Another option is to use a video editor to make an intro and an end screen.</li><li>If your Instagram story is too long, you can cut it down using any Instagram video editor. Record the video, then open it in your app to edit and trim it down before selecting the clips to upload the full story.</li><li>In addition, if your Instagram ad video is longer than 15 seconds, Instagram provides 10 cards, each with a 15-second video duration limit. This will allow you to show your complete advertisement without compressing it.</li><li>The four-hour limit seems insufficient if you wish to have a more extended live stream on Instagram. Then, as soon as you reach the time restriction, you can easily go live again and re-start the stream as many times as you wish.</li><li>To make videos that will receive hundreds of likes on Instagram, you’ll need video editing software that allows you to change the aspect ratio of the videos you wish to submit. Wondershare Filmora is a video editing program that supports a wide range of video file formats and allows you to crop and prepare your videos for web use.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> That’s all there is to know about the length of Instagram videos. Isn’t it simple? Take the advice above, make your videos as long as possible, and post when your followers are online, and your post engagement and follower count will skyrocket.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"

For business accounts, think of the Instagram Highlights as a specifically curated folder where your audience can find all the information they need in an organized manner.

Organize and Categorize Your Highlights Strategically</h3><p>When curating Instagram Highlights for your business account it is imperative that the content is placed in categories that are organized by their purpose.</p><p>For example, if you create a Highlight meant to showcase your hours of operation, you would <em>not</em> include a story that features new products. When your audience is looking to gain more information about your business they want to find this information with ease.</p><p>Naming your Instagram Highlight must be done strategically so that users can find what they are looking for without any guesswork. Additionally, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >creating a cover image <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your highlight that coincides with the content will also better suit your business account.

Showcasing Products&#x2F;Services"></a>3. Showcasing Products&#x2F;Services</h3><p>One of the most successful ways you can utilize Instagram Highlights for your business account is to showcase the product and&#x2F;or service you are selling. A Highlight specific to these items is a lot quicker and easier for your audience to digest.</p><p>This feature is particularly beneficial for e-commerce businesses. You can implement the “swipe up” feature (if you have over 10,000 followers) to take your customers directly to your product pages. Products can also be tagged and take users to your Instagram Shop!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-story-highlight-show-product.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight show product"                ></p><h3 id="4-Make-Company-Announcements"><a href="#4-Make-Company-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="4.

This is the place to house that content. While it may seem difficult to make people care about updates and announcements to your business, you can curate content for this Highlight in a way that engages your audience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-highlight-company-announcement.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight company announcement"                ></p><h3 id="5-Promote-Events"><a href="#5-Promote-Events" class="headerlink" title="5.

Make sure to include stories that provide the date, time and location of your event. Don’t forget that you can utilize other Instagram functions such as the “poll” to help you gain an understanding of how many people will be coming to your event.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-highlight-promote-event.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight promote event"                ></p><h3 id="6-Interact-with-your-Audience"><a href="#6-Interact-with-your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="6.

But don’t limit these interactions to 24 hours. By including an interactive Highlight on your business Instagram, you can learn all kinds of things about your customers.</p><p>Another key interaction tool that would help boost your business account is the question feature. This feature allows you to ask your audience questions and get their feedback in real time. Their responses will be sent directly to your Direct Message box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/interact-with-audience-instagram-highlight.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight interact with audience"                ></p><h3 id="7-Answer-Frequently-Asked-Questions-FAQ"><a href="#7-Answer-Frequently-Asked-Questions-FAQ" class="headerlink" title="7.

You’d be surprised how the easiest of details can be forgotten. Try including the question feature as one of your slides, so that users can submit questions they have that you can include in the Highlight moving forward.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-frequently-asked-question.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight  usage - show faq"                ></p><h3 id="8-How-To-Guides"><a href="#8-How-To-Guides" class="headerlink" title="8.

Showing your customers the proper way to use your product will help instill trust in your brand. This is especially important if the product you are selling is on the high-end spectrum. If potential buyers can see the outcome of the product once put together or used, they might be more inclined to purchase from you.</p><h3 id="9-Showcase-Reviews-Testimonials"><a href="#9-Showcase-Reviews-Testimonials" class="headerlink" title="9.

The more positive testimonials and reviews you can promote, the more trustworthy your brand becomes.</p><h3 id="10-Share-Promotions-Deals"><a href="#10-Share-Promotions-Deals" class="headerlink" title="10.

Offering deals to new and existing customers prompts users to interact with your business and generate sales. Running a giveaway on your Instagram can also help build your following. To do so you must include conditions of the giveaway that requires users to follow you and interact with your content in order to be entered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-highlight-share-promotion.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight  usage - share promotion"                ></p><p>Your business matters to you, and using Instagram Highlights for your business account helps make it matter to your audience.

Showing your customers the proper way to use your product will help instill trust in your brand. This is especially important if the product you are selling is on the high-end spectrum. If potential buyers can see the outcome of the product once put together or used, they might be more inclined to purchase from you.</p><h3 id="9-Showcase-Reviews-Testimonials-2"><a href="#9-Showcase-Reviews-Testimonials-2" class="headerlink" title="9.

For business accounts, think of the Instagram Highlights as a specifically curated folder where your audience can find all the information they need in an organized manner. The better curated your Highlights, the more your audience can understand who you are and what you do or sell.</p><h3 id="1-Organize-and-Categorize-Your-Highlights-Strategically-3"><a href="#1-Organize-and-Categorize-Your-Highlights-Strategically-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Organize and Categorize Your Highlights Strategically"></a>1. Organize and Categorize Your Highlights Strategically</h3><p>When curating Instagram Highlights for your business account it is imperative that the content is placed in categories that are organized by their purpose.</p><p>For example, if you create a Highlight meant to showcase your hours of operation, you would <em>not</em> include a story that features new products. When your audience is looking to gain more information about your business they want to find this information with ease.</p><p>Naming your Instagram Highlight must be done strategically so that users can find what they are looking for without any guesswork. Additionally, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >creating a cover image <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your highlight that coincides with the content will also better suit your business account.

Reels is a video feature that allows users to make 15-second multi-clip snaps. You can add various effects, set a time limit for the clip, set the speed, and most importantly, you can also add audio (similar to Instagram Music). It was first launched in Brazil as a trial run and is now available in about 50 countries worldwide.

Swipe left or click on the camera button on the top left corner to open the camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/launch-instagram-app1.jpg"                      alt="launch instagram app"                ></p><p>2.

You will now have tools for editing your Reel on the left of your screen.</p><p>4. The four tools you can use are Audio, AR effects, Timer and Countdown, Align, and Speed. The <strong>Audio</strong> tool allows you to add any audio from the Instagram music library to your Reel. You can also use original audios, which will then be attributed to you, and your viewers can use that audio in their own Reels by selecting “Use Audio.” You can also choose different <strong>AR effects</strong> to enhance your Reels. The AR effects may be created by Instagram or its users. <strong>Timer and Countdown</strong> can be used to set a time limit for a single clip and set a countdown so that you can settle in before it starts recording. The <strong>Align</strong> feature smoothens the process of transitioning from one clip to another. Last but not least, you can also set the <strong>Speed</strong> of your Reel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-tab.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Reels Tab"                ></p><p>5. Use these tools to make a Reel as per your choice. Click on Next or Done.</p><p>6. You can add your caption and choose a cover for your Reel from the video or gallery on the Share page. You also have the option to Share to Feed. You can also save it as a draft if you don’t wish to upload it immediately. Otherwise, just click on “Share” to share it on the Explore page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-reels-on-instagram.jpg"                      alt="share reels on instagram"                ></p><h3 id="How-to-use-Instagram-Stories"><a href="#How-to-use-Instagram-Stories" class="headerlink" title="# How to use Instagram Stories?"></a># How to use Instagram Stories?</h3><p>Instagram Stories are a way for people to interact with their followers on a day-to-day basis. For this purpose, people often make stories of themselves or their surroundings. To do that, follow these steps.</p><p>1. Tap on the camera icon on the top left corner or swipe left to open the camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-insta-stories-1.jpg"                      alt="how to use instagram story"                ></p><p>2. You can then record a video or capture a photo. You can use various filters or add text and stickers to your Story, move and resize the text and stickers as per your need. You can also upload anything from your camera roll. To do that, simply swipe up after the camera opens.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-insta-stories-3.jpg"                      alt="posting a instagram story"                ></p><p>3. When you are done editing your Story, tap on “Your Story” to upload it. You also have the option to share it only with your “Close Friends” or DM it to someone by tapping on “Send to.”</p><p>4. You can view your own Story by tapping on your profile picture at the top of the Home page.</p><h2 id="Differences-between-Instagram-Reels-and-Stories"><a href="#Differences-between-Instagram-Reels-and-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Differences between Instagram Reels and Stories"></a>Differences between Instagram Reels and Stories</h2><p>Now let’s take a look at the difference between these two, Instagram Reels and Instagram Stories.</p><ul><li><strong>Time Availability:</strong> Instagram stories disappear after 24 hours unless they are saved in your highlights. While Instagram Reels stays in your Reels tab and feed.</li><li><strong>Length:</strong> For the Instagram stories, a video’s maximum length is 15 seconds, and for a picture, it is 7 seconds. For Instagram Reels, the maximum limit is 15 seconds too.</li><li><strong>Hashtags:</strong> Hashtags are used to gain more reach on everything you post. For the Instagram Stories, if you add a hashtag, the users must tap to see your Story. Since there are many stories, the chances of yours showing up are low. Plus, the Story disappears after 24 hours. For Instagram Reels, when a hashtag is searched, the Reels show up at the top due to the algorithm settings. This ensures maximum reach.</li><li><strong>Reach:</strong> Mostly, the people who view Instagram Stories are the followers of the account. In the case of Instagram Reels, people who do not follow can also view your Reels, increasing your reach.</li><li><strong>Saves:</strong> An Instagram Story of someone cannot be saved for you to view later. The Instagram Reels can be saved by the users.</li><li><strong>Explore Page:</strong> Instagram Stories rarely get featured on the explore page. On the other hand, Instagram Reels take the most space, ensuring they are watched the most.</li><li><strong>Editing tools:</strong> For the Stories, you can access filters, different layouts, and camera effects. While Instagram Reels gives access to more devices such as Audio editing, AR effects, Alignment of several clips and pictures, Timer, and Countdown, you can also control your actions’ speed.</li><li><strong>Sharing:</strong> Instagram Stories can be shared as a story or be sent to someone’s inbox, but they disappear 24 hours. Instagram Reels can be shared by almost anyone and do not disappear.</li></ul><h2 id="Is-My-Video-Suitable-of-Instagram-Reels-or-Stories"><a href="#Is-My-Video-Suitable-of-Instagram-Reels-or-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Is My Video Suitable of Instagram Reels or Stories?"></a>Is My Video Suitable of Instagram Reels or Stories?</h2><p>As discussed above in the section that focuses on using both the features, the type of content can be understood. Instagram Reels focuses more on content creation, while Instagram Stories focuses more on real-time events. A dance video is suitable for Instagram Reels, while a video made while traveling is suitable for an Instagram story. Sometimes an edited travel video can also be shared on Reels as content, while a rawer version is suitable for Instagram Stories.</p><p>So, in essence, anything that you want to reach to the world, anything that showcases your talents, is suitable for Instagram Reels. While anything you do as a recreational activity, whether it is dining out, reading a book, visiting a new place, or capturing a momentous occasion that is mostly personal, all these things is perfect and suitable for Instagram Stories.</p><h2 id="Make-Your-Instagram-Reels-Video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Make-Your-Instagram-Reels-Video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Make Your Instagram Reels Video with Filmora"></a>Make Your Instagram Reels Video with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>To increase your views on Instagram Reels, a well-edited video is a must-have.

While anything you do as a recreational activity, whether it is dining out, reading a book, visiting a new place, or capturing a momentous occasion that is mostly personal, all these things is perfect and suitable for Instagram Stories.</p><h2 id="Make-Your-Instagram-Reels-Video-with-Filmora-3"><a href="#Make-Your-Instagram-Reels-Video-with-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Make Your Instagram Reels Video with Filmora"></a>Make Your Instagram Reels Video with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>To increase your views on Instagram Reels, a well-edited video is a must-have.

All you need is an internet connection, and you’re good to go. Are you excited yet? But hold your horses, because these aren’t the only perks that InstagramSave offers.

CHOOSE VIDEO: Open the video that you are crushing over and wish to download to be watched repeatedly and that too in excellent resolution.</p><p>2. COPY URL: Tap the three dots on the top right corner of the desired video and click on ‘Copy Link,’ which is the URL in the boring tech language, so don’t confuse yourself and follow my lead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/copy-instagram-video-link1.jpg"                      alt="copy instagram video link"                ></p><p>3.

Click on ‘New Project’ and then tap ‘Files,’ select ‘Import Media’ from the dropdown menu, and then ‘Import Media Files’ to add the selected video to your library.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-instagram-video-to-filmora1.jpg"                      alt="import new video file"                ></p><p>3. Drag and drop the video onto the timeline (Don’t change the resolution if a dialogue box pops up). Then click on ‘File’ again and select ‘Project Settings’. Choose the resolution of 1080×1080 or 1:1 square, the optimum resolution for your Instagram video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fit-instagram-aspect-ratio2.jpg"                      alt="change to instagram mode"                ></p><p>4. Go to ‘Media, select ‘Sample Colors’, and choose your liking color to introduce the cinematic effect by adding colored bars above and below the video. Then you can scale up or down the video size in the preview window directly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-background-to-instagram-video3.jpg"                      alt="add white color background"                ></p><p>5. To get the viewer’s attention, you can add texts for maximum effect. Click ‘Titles’ and drag and drop a specific text style onto the third track.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-titles-to-instagram-video4.jpg"                      alt="go to titles tab"                ></p><p>6. Double click the title on the track, tap <strong>ADVANCED</strong>, choose a text style, change the font color, and apply an animation to the text as you like.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-and-customize-text5.jpg"                      alt="apply animation to text"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> In the ‘Audio’ tab, you can import your own music and add it to the video. And double click the audio you add, you will be able to fade in, fade out and denoise the audio.</p><p>7. Press ‘Export’ and choose the device you wish to save the video on. You can upload the exported video to Instagram once you finish the export process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-tinder-loop-export-video.jpg"                      alt="export instagram video"                ></p><h2 id="CONCLUSION"><a href="#CONCLUSION" class="headerlink" title="CONCLUSION"></a>CONCLUSION</h2><p>The bottom line is that we discussed the two main methods of converting your favorite Instagram videos to MP4. It doesn’t matter whether you have an internet connection or not. You will be able to convert either way. Both offline and online Instagram to MP4 converter is very efficient.

You have probably heard about companies getting Instagram influencers to market their products or services. Since influencers have tens to hundreds of thousands of followers, they offer companies a wide reach in these marketing campaigns. But how can you find Instagram influencers on a tight budget?</p><p> We attempt to explain the process of finding the right Instagram influencers for your niche marketing campaign.</p><h2 id="Five-Steps-to-Find-Instagram-Influencers-in-Your-Niche-for-Free"><a href="#Five-Steps-to-Find-Instagram-Influencers-in-Your-Niche-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Five Steps to Find Instagram Influencers in Your Niche - for Free"></a>Five Steps to Find Instagram Influencers in Your Niche - for Free</h2><h3 id="Step-1-Establish-Your-Criteria"><a href="#Step-1-Establish-Your-Criteria" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Establish Your Criteria"></a>Step 1: Establish Your Criteria</h3><p> Before you go any further in the search for influencers, it is important to understand your marketing goals. Being able to find Instagram influencers is a lot easier when you have concrete goals.</p><p> Too many people think that if you find an Instagram influencer who has close to a million followers, you are all set. But it is not that simple. Yes, you want to find influencers who have many followers, as they will increase your brand exposure.</p><p> But what matters the most is finding the right influencer. It is why establishing a criteria for the influencer is important. This should be done before any search begins.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-influencer-criteria.JPG"                      alt="ins influencer criteria"                ></p><p> The <a class="link"   href="https://destinationthink.com/nine-criteria-selecting-right-people-next-influencer-campaign/" >type of criteria <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you could use in the search is whether they have an engaged audience, whether that audience is relevant to your company and the type of content they create.</p><p> Say an Instagram influencer has a million followers, but the number of likes and comments they get on a post is fairly unremarkable. It is a sign they have low engagement. In some cases, a person with around 100,000 followers and high engagement is better than someone with a million followers and low engagement.</p><p> It is crucial to assess the relevance of an influencer’s audience to your company. For instance, if you are selling computer gaming headsets, you must find an influencer whose audience shares an interest in gaming. If the influencer you find is a model who is followed for hair and makeup tips, using them would not be very useful to your marketing goals.</p><p> Finally, the influencer must create great content. You will be offering them a product or service in exchange for the branded content they will produce. And you are relying on that content being great.</p><h3 id="Step-2-Analyze-Your-Followers"><a href="#Step-2-Analyze-Your-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Analyze Your Followers"></a>Step 2: Analyze Your Followers</h3><p> It is surprising how many companies are able to find influencers just by looking through their own followers. Assess your Instagram account and see if you can find users who are regularly liking posts or commenting on them.</p><p> When you find users who have a high engagement on your profile, you can assess their profiles to see if any of them have high follower counts. If one or two of them have more than 10,000 followers, they could be useful to you for influencer marketing.</p><p> Even if you do not find anything through your own followers, you can always use related keyword hashtags to find influencers who are interested in the products or services that your company offers.</p><h3 id="Step-3-Use-an-Influencer-Network"><a href="#Step-3-Use-an-Influencer-Network" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Use an Influencer Network"></a>Step 3: Use an Influencer Network</h3><p> There are some very useful influencer networks that are available for free. While the free networks do not have the same analysis as paid varieties, they are still very useful in the search for Instagram influencers.</p><p> You can use an influencer network to find Instagram influencers who may have an interest in the niche that your company is targeting. All you need is a few promising leads that may be interested in talking and collaborating with your company.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-influencer-network.JPG"                      alt="ins influencer network"                ></p><h3 id="Step-4-Contact-Instagram-Influencers"><a href="#Step-4-Contact-Instagram-Influencers" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Contact Instagram Influencers"></a>Step 4: Contact Instagram Influencers</h3><p> Through steps two and three, you should have been able to get at least 10 to 15 names of Instagram influencers who are interested in your niche. If you got lucky, you may have found a couple who have a serious interest in your company, making the coming talks even easier.</p><p> Most influencers will have an email address that you can use to contact them for business enquiries. Use that address to send them a formal message. If they do not have any contact method, you can always send them a direct message on Instagram to get their attention.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/contact-instagram-influencers.JPG"                      alt="contact influencer"                ></p><p> When contacting an influencer, make sure you are being very open about the invitation. Talk about your company and brand, mention the product or service you are interested in an influencer marketing, and discuss the potential budget. If you want the influencer’s help for free, make sure you are mentioning this fact in the initial message.</p><p> Do not feel disheartened if a few influencers ignore your messages. There are so many companies contacting influencers for their assistance. It is normal that some message will be ignored or lost in the shuffle.</p><p> It is why you must cast your net far and wide. Contact as many relevant influencers as you can. The more people you contact, the greater your chance of getting into a collaboration with a few influencers for free.</p><h3 id="Step-5-Watch-Out-for-Competitors"><a href="#Step-5-Watch-Out-for-Competitors" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Watch Out for Competitors"></a>Step 5: Watch Out for Competitors</h3><p> A great way to find influencers who may be interested in promoting your products or services is by looking at what your competitors are doing.</p><p> Do not focus on the most popular company in the niche, as they may be able to offer influencers better compensation.</p><p> Look at companies in the niche who have a similar size and profile to your company. You can look at all the posts where your competitors have been tagged in. These posts will show you if there are popular Instagram influencers who are advertising the products or services that your competitors are offering.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> It can be hard to find Instagram influencers for a niche marketing campaign, especially if you are working on a limited budget. But the good news is that influencers also want to raise their profile by working with brands in their niche. It can be a mutually beneficial relationship. And if your company continues to grow through the marketing you are doing with Instagram influencers, you could even establish a long term relationship with that influencer.</p><p> If you are planning to edit Instagram video, you might want to try Filmora right now.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><h5 id="Shanoon-Cox-1"><a href="#Shanoon-Cox-1" class="headerlink" title="Shanoon Cox"></a>Shanoon Cox</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> Using Instagram influencers for marketing purposes has become a very relevant tactic for businesses.

Being able to find Instagram influencers is a lot easier when you have concrete goals.</p><p> Too many people think that if you find an Instagram influencer who has close to a million followers, you are all set. But it is not that simple. Yes, you want to find influencers who have many followers, as they will increase your brand exposure.</p><p> But what matters the most is finding the right influencer. It is why establishing a criteria for the influencer is important. This should be done before any search begins.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-influencer-criteria.JPG"                      alt="ins influencer criteria"                ></p><p> The <a class="link"   href="https://destinationthink.com/nine-criteria-selecting-right-people-next-influencer-campaign/" >type of criteria <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you could use in the search is whether they have an engaged audience, whether that audience is relevant to your company and the type of content they create.</p><p> Say an Instagram influencer has a million followers, but the number of likes and comments they get on a post is fairly unremarkable. It is a sign they have low engagement. In some cases, a person with around 100,000 followers and high engagement is better than someone with a million followers and low engagement.</p><p> It is crucial to assess the relevance of an influencer’s audience to your company. For instance, if you are selling computer gaming headsets, you must find an influencer whose audience shares an interest in gaming. If the influencer you find is a model who is followed for hair and makeup tips, using them would not be very useful to your marketing goals.</p><p> Finally, the influencer must create great content.

The action looks so slow that you think everything has stopped moving but in reality, it hasn’t – just slower than our eyes can normally perceive.</p><p>Slow-motion video is popular on Instagram Reels as well. In this article, we will show you how to</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Slow Motion?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">How To Record Only Part Of A Video In Slow Motion On Reels?</a></p><p>05 <a href="#part5">How to Convert Normal Speed Video to Slow Motion For Reels?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Slow-Motion"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Slow-Motion" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Slow Motion?"></a>Part 1: What is Slow Motion?</h2><p>Slow-motion can be achieved by either dropping frames from a video sequence, or simply playing the existing frames in slow succession. It lets you capture some fun clips by turning everyday things into something special. For example, water droplets falling and causing different effects as they splatter and spread can be really fascinating to see, just like paint dropping onto a giant canvas.</p><p>That’s why it is very important to use high-resolution recording when shooting such video to prevent the stuttering effect. The higher the frame rate, the more we can slow down the action without noticeable jarring because each frame will be captured in more detail.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a new feature within the Instagram app where users can create short 15-second videos and add them to their Instagram Stories. The new tool plays with time and motion in a creative way by letting you record clips but only keeps the last 15 seconds. While this might seem to limit at first, it actually opens up some creative possibilities for creating interesting vignettes. But how does the Instagram reels slow motion function work?</p><p>The secret behind Instagram reels slow-motion lies in its audio features. When recording a video, regardless of whether it’s in normal or slow-motion mode, you’ll be able to select songs from any music library that’s available on your device, add sound effects, and add voiceovers. Instagram takes advantage of this by speeding up the audio to a normal speed when you’re recording in slow motion and then slowing it down just enough so that it sounds natural when you playback the video at 1x speed. This means that your Reels videos will have a consistent volume even if you choose a song from a playlist with differing volumes.</p><p>This gives Reels users an interesting option: they can use songs from playlists where each track varies in terms of volume, thus creating some sort of visual story-telling through their 15-second clips.</p><p>But that’s not all; once you’ve recorded your video, you can add filters and editing tools to give it even more life.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a feature that lets users create short videos consisting of multiple photos or clips placed together in order of their choice. The reels can be created from posts made by the user as well as from the user’s camera roll containing photos and videos taken before. These can even be edited further to add some filters or text to them. Once you are done creating a reel, you can share it on your Instagram story for friends and followers to see.</p><p>To understand how to make slow-motion video on Instagram reels, follow these steps:</p><p>First, launch the Instagram app and swipe right to reach the camera page. Alternatively, you could tap the Story button in the top left corner.</p><p>Now tap ‘Reels’ in the bottom panel beside ‘Story.’ You can select the time from here. The maximum time allowed is 60 sec for a reel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-recording-time-option.jpg"                      alt="instagram reels recording time option"                ></p><p>When recording a slow-motion video on Reels, you need to set the speed before you record the video. To do so, tap the ‘Speed’ button below your selected photo or clip-on Reels and select either 0.3x or 0.5x from the two options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-recording-speed-option.jpg"                      alt="instagram reels recording speed option"                ></p><p>Tap the camera button beside the ‘Speed’ button to take a test shot and see if you are satisfied with the speed. If not, either change it or tap the x on top to cancel this particular video. Once you are happy with your speed, tap on the red record button next to it to start recording your slow-motion video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-instagram-reels-video-slow-motion.jpg"                      alt="record instagram reels video slow motion"                ></p><p>While playing back your slow-motion video, swipe left or right on the screen to play at normal speed as well as 0.3x and 0.5x speeds, respectively, for comparison purposes. Keep swiping left and right until you find the perfect playback speed for your clip. You can also pinch inwards or outwards while watching a slow-motion video to adjust what you see in its frame at a particular time.</p><p>To stop recording, click on the red button. You can see a preview by clicking on the Preview button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-instagram-reels-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="preview instagram reels slow motion video"                ></p><p>If you are okay with the video, click Next. Now, share it with reels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-instagram-reels-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="share instagram reels slow motion video"                ></p><p>Since the playback speed is not the only factor responsible for making videos look really slow-motion, it is equally important to ensure that your shots have an ample amount of action and motion in them. This way, when you choose to play them back at regular speeds or slower ones, their contents will be discernible enough to make a lasting impression on your audience. Depending on the kind of video you want to shoot, simply increase or decrease the number of clips that you use as well as their duration.</p><p>So, what more should you cater to understand how to make slow motion reels on Instagram?</p><p>When editing videos using Reels, make sure they don’t consist of too many unrelated photographs and videos. Try to make a video containing a single concept if possible; otherwise, it will be difficult for your audience to follow. Also, you can add effects or filters before publishing them on the platform, based on which they will look more impressive. In addition to this, you can also create longer slideshows of multiple reels by simply playing them one after the other either in the same order as that in which they were stacked together or by shuffling their order.</p><p>Play around with these settings and see what works best for you.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Record-Only-Part-Of-A-Video-In-Slow-Motion-On-Reels"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Record-Only-Part-Of-A-Video-In-Slow-Motion-On-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How To Record Only Part Of A Video In Slow Motion On Reels?"></a>Part 4: How To Record Only Part Of A Video In Slow Motion On Reels?</h2><p>On Instagram, you can record a video in slow motion. You can even go further and record only a portion of your video in slow motion while the rest plays at an average speed rate. This gives an interesting effect to your videos where you’d want some parts to be played at normal speed and others played in slow motion.</p><ul><li>In this way, you can create exciting reels that will make people notice what they are all about! To do this, Go to the Instagram camera or Story page, and select Reels option.</li><li>You’ll have the choice to speed up or slow down various portions of the video or audio by selecting the speed as in the previous section. For instance, if you want the first 20 seconds of video to be a slow motion at the speed of 0.3x, then select as shown below.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-part-of-instagram-reels-slow-motion-recording.jpg"                      alt="start part of instagram reels slow motion recording"                ></p><ul><li>And record the video till 40 seconds are left and stop. Now select speed 1x for the rest of the video to record a complete video.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-instagram-reels-part-slow-motion.jpg"                      alt="record instagram reels part slow motion"                ></p><ul><li>This video will be in slow motion for the first 20 seconds, and the rest of the video will play at normal speed. You can see the white line in the image below depicting slow motion before the line and normal motion after the line. You can see the preview by clicking “Preview.” If you are happy with the creation, you can share it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-normal-speed-video-instagram-reels.jpg"                      alt="record normal speed video instagram reels"                ></p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Convert-Normal-Speed-Video-to-Slow-Motion-For-Reels"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Convert-Normal-Speed-Video-to-Slow-Motion-For-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Convert Normal Speed Video to Slow Motion For Reels?"></a>Part 5: How to Convert Normal Speed Video to Slow Motion For Reels?</h2><p>If you have recorded a video with normal speed and now want to turn it into slow motion for sharing on Instagram Reels, you will need to convert normal speed video to slow motion.

When recording a video, regardless of whether it’s in normal or slow-motion mode, you’ll be able to select songs from any music library that’s available on your device, add sound effects, and add voiceovers. Instagram takes advantage of this by speeding up the audio to a normal speed when you’re recording in slow motion and then slowing it down just enough so that it sounds natural when you playback the video at 1x speed. This means that your Reels videos will have a consistent volume even if you choose a song from a playlist with differing volumes.</p><p>This gives Reels users an interesting option: they can use songs from playlists where each track varies in terms of volume, thus creating some sort of visual story-telling through their 15-second clips.</p><p>But that’s not all; once you’ve recorded your video, you can add filters and editing tools to give it even more life.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a feature that lets users create short videos consisting of multiple photos or clips placed together in order of their choice. The reels can be created from posts made by the user as well as from the user’s camera roll containing photos and videos taken before. These can even be edited further to add some filters or text to them. Once you are done creating a reel, you can share it on your Instagram story for friends and followers to see.</p><p>To understand how to make slow-motion video on Instagram reels, follow these steps:</p><p>First, launch the Instagram app and swipe right to reach the camera page. Alternatively, you could tap the Story button in the top left corner.</p><p>Now tap ‘Reels’ in the bottom panel beside ‘Story.’ You can select the time from here. The maximum time allowed is 60 sec for a reel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-recording-time-option.jpg"                      alt="instagram reels recording time option"                ></p><p>When recording a slow-motion video on Reels, you need to set the speed before you record the video. To do so, tap the ‘Speed’ button below your selected photo or clip-on Reels and select either 0.3x or 0.5x from the two options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-recording-speed-option.jpg"                      alt="instagram reels recording speed option"                ></p><p>Tap the camera button beside the ‘Speed’ button to take a test shot and see if you are satisfied with the speed. If not, either change it or tap the x on top to cancel this particular video. Once you are happy with your speed, tap on the red record button next to it to start recording your slow-motion video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-instagram-reels-video-slow-motion.jpg"                      alt="record instagram reels video slow motion"                ></p><p>While playing back your slow-motion video, swipe left or right on the screen to play at normal speed as well as 0.3x and 0.5x speeds, respectively, for comparison purposes. Keep swiping left and right until you find the perfect playback speed for your clip. You can also pinch inwards or outwards while watching a slow-motion video to adjust what you see in its frame at a particular time.</p><p>To stop recording, click on the red button. You can see a preview by clicking on the Preview button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-instagram-reels-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="preview instagram reels slow motion video"                ></p><p>If you are okay with the video, click Next. Now, share it with reels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-instagram-reels-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="share instagram reels slow motion video"                ></p><p>Since the playback speed is not the only factor responsible for making videos look really slow-motion, it is equally important to ensure that your shots have an ample amount of action and motion in them. This way, when you choose to play them back at regular speeds or slower ones, their contents will be discernible enough to make a lasting impression on your audience. Depending on the kind of video you want to shoot, simply increase or decrease the number of clips that you use as well as their duration.</p><p>So, what more should you cater to understand how to make slow motion reels on Instagram?</p><p>When editing videos using Reels, make sure they don’t consist of too many unrelated photographs and videos. Try to make a video containing a single concept if possible; otherwise, it will be difficult for your audience to follow. Also, you can add effects or filters before publishing them on the platform, based on which they will look more impressive. In addition to this, you can also create longer slideshows of multiple reels by simply playing them one after the other either in the same order as that in which they were stacked together or by shuffling their order.</p><p>Play around with these settings and see what works best for you.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Record-Only-Part-Of-A-Video-In-Slow-Motion-On-Reels-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Record-Only-Part-Of-A-Video-In-Slow-Motion-On-Reels-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How To Record Only Part Of A Video In Slow Motion On Reels?"></a>Part 4: How To Record Only Part Of A Video In Slow Motion On Reels?</h2><p>On Instagram, you can record a video in slow motion. You can even go further and record only a portion of your video in slow motion while the rest plays at an average speed rate. This gives an interesting effect to your videos where you’d want some parts to be played at normal speed and others played in slow motion.</p><ul><li>In this way, you can create exciting reels that will make people notice what they are all about! To do this, Go to the Instagram camera or Story page, and select Reels option.</li><li>You’ll have the choice to speed up or slow down various portions of the video or audio by selecting the speed as in the previous section. For instance, if you want the first 20 seconds of video to be a slow motion at the speed of 0.3x, then select as shown below.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-part-of-instagram-reels-slow-motion-recording.jpg"                      alt="start part of instagram reels slow motion recording"                ></p><ul><li>And record the video till 40 seconds are left and stop. Now select speed 1x for the rest of the video to record a complete video.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-instagram-reels-part-slow-motion.jpg"                      alt="record instagram reels part slow motion"                ></p><ul><li>This video will be in slow motion for the first 20 seconds, and the rest of the video will play at normal speed. You can see the white line in the image below depicting slow motion before the line and normal motion after the line. You can see the preview by clicking “Preview.” If you are happy with the creation, you can share it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-normal-speed-video-instagram-reels.jpg"                      alt="record normal speed video instagram reels"                ></p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Convert-Normal-Speed-Video-to-Slow-Motion-For-Reels-3"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Convert-Normal-Speed-Video-to-Slow-Motion-For-Reels-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Convert Normal Speed Video to Slow Motion For Reels?"></a>Part 5: How to Convert Normal Speed Video to Slow Motion For Reels?</h2><p>If you have recorded a video with normal speed and now want to turn it into slow motion for sharing on Instagram Reels, you will need to convert normal speed video to slow motion.

Before IGTV was launched the maximum duration of a video on Instagram was limited to just one minute, which made this platform better suited for photos than videos. Today you can upload videos that last up to ten minutes regardless of the type of account you have, and if you own a verified account you can even share hour-long videos on your channel. In case you were trying to find out how you can shoot IGTV videos with your Smartphone or DSLR camera, you’re at the right place because in this article we are going to show you how to create videos that are going to impress your followers.</p><h2 id="How-to-Record-IGTV-Videos-With-a-Smartphone"><a href="#How-to-Record-IGTV-Videos-With-a-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="How to Record IGTV Videos With a Smartphone?"></a>How to Record IGTV Videos With a Smartphone?</h2><p>Before you can actually start uploading videos to IGTV, you first need to create your own channel. Once you’ve managed this step, you can then proceed to check if you have all the equipment you need to record a video. Obviously, you’re going to need a Smartphone that has a relatively <strong>powerful rear camera capable of capturing videos in HD or Ultra HD quality</strong>. You can only upload <strong>vertically oriented videos</strong> to IGTV, which is why it is slightly easier to record an IGTV video with a Smartphone than it is with a DSLR camera.</p><p>However, iPhones and Android devices are incredibly light and keeping them perfectly steady in your hand while recording is often difficult. That’s why you need a <strong>tripod for your Smartphone</strong> that will ensure that the footage is free of camera shakes. Both iOS and Android-based devices have their <strong>native camera app</strong> you can use to record IGTV videos, but if you would like to have <strong>professional camera features</strong> at your disposal during video recording sessions you should consider installing an app like <a class="link"   href="http://promovieapp.com/" >ProMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="http://cinemafv5.com/" >Cinema FV-5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your phone.</p><p><strong>Built-in microphones on Smartphones</strong> often pick up background noises or capture sound in low quality, so if you’re shooting your IGTV videos in less than perfect conditions, using an <strong>external microphone</strong> instead of the one on your phone might improve the quality of your video significantly. Optionally, you can skip recoding audio altogether and add music to your IGTV videos in the post-production.</p><p>The type of video you’re trying to create determines which pieces of equipment you’re going to need, since shooting a simple video of you walking down the street is quite different from recording an interview.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >&gt;&gt; Blue Screen VS Green Screen: All You Need to Know <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Shoot-IGTV-Videos-With-a-DSLR-Camera"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-IGTV-Videos-With-a-DSLR-Camera" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot IGTV Videos With a DSLR Camera?"></a>How to Shoot IGTV Videos With a DSLR Camera?</h2><p>Learning how to operate a DLSR camera takes time and practice, so in order to capture professional-looking videos, you need to use the camera as often as you can. Adjusting the exposure value or pulling focus manually may seem difficult when you first start producing videos, but learning how to do these things will make you a better cinematographer, and it will enable you to create brilliant content for your IGTV channel.</p><p>All you need to do when recording a video for IGTV is to <strong>turn your camera horizontally</strong>, in order to capture the video in the <strong>aspect ratio that matches the aspect ratio supported by the IGTV platform</strong>. Keep in mind that videos are commonly recorded in the landscape format and that you should only shoot vertical videos if you want to upload them to a platform like IGTV that only lets its users upload videos in the portrait format.</p><p>Unlike smartphones, DSLR cameras allow you to <strong>change the lens</strong>, which enables you to create a certain visual style by simply using a lens with a different focal length. In most cases, you’ll want to use a <strong>standard 18-55mm lens</strong> to record your IGTV videos because this type of lens can be used for a wide variety of different scenes. <strong>Ultra-wide lenses</strong> can create an entertaining effect by distorting the space depicted in the video, and they are often used to create video content for social media platforms.</p><p>Shooting videos on DSLR cameras also mean that you need access to a <strong>video editing software</strong>, because the raw footage often contains parts you don’t want to include in the final cut of your video. Professional video editing software products like <strong>Final Cut Pro or Premiere Pro</strong> may be too challenging for inexperienced video editors, and if you are still learning the ropes of the trade you should try using a less demanding video editing app for Mac and PC computers like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FUS.html" >PowerDirector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The editing room is where your next IGTV video is going to get its final form, and you shouldn’t skip this step of the video production process just because it is time-consuming. If you want to impress your audience on IGTV you should work slowly and relentlessly on your footage until you are perfectly happy with the result.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>You don’t have to be a professional in order to record an IGTV video, but you still need to have at least basic knowledge about how cameras work and how you can use them to create vertical videos.

In case you were trying to find out how you can shoot IGTV videos with your Smartphone or DSLR camera, you’re at the right place because in this article we are going to show you how to create videos that are going to impress your followers.</p><h2 id="How-to-Record-IGTV-Videos-With-a-Smartphone-2"><a href="#How-to-Record-IGTV-Videos-With-a-Smartphone-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Record IGTV Videos With a Smartphone?"></a>How to Record IGTV Videos With a Smartphone?</h2><p>Before you can actually start uploading videos to IGTV, you first need to create your own channel. Once you’ve managed this step, you can then proceed to check if you have all the equipment you need to record a video. Obviously, you’re going to need a Smartphone that has a relatively <strong>powerful rear camera capable of capturing videos in HD or Ultra HD quality</strong>. You can only upload <strong>vertically oriented videos</strong> to IGTV, which is why it is slightly easier to record an IGTV video with a Smartphone than it is with a DSLR camera.</p><p>However, iPhones and Android devices are incredibly light and keeping them perfectly steady in your hand while recording is often difficult. That’s why you need a <strong>tripod for your Smartphone</strong> that will ensure that the footage is free of camera shakes. Both iOS and Android-based devices have their <strong>native camera app</strong> you can use to record IGTV videos, but if you would like to have <strong>professional camera features</strong> at your disposal during video recording sessions you should consider installing an app like <a class="link"   href="http://promovieapp.com/" >ProMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="http://cinemafv5.com/" >Cinema FV-5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your phone.</p><p><strong>Built-in microphones on Smartphones</strong> often pick up background noises or capture sound in low quality, so if you’re shooting your IGTV videos in less than perfect conditions, using an <strong>external microphone</strong> instead of the one on your phone might improve the quality of your video significantly. Optionally, you can skip recoding audio altogether and add music to your IGTV videos in the post-production.</p><p>The type of video you’re trying to create determines which pieces of equipment you’re going to need, since shooting a simple video of you walking down the street is quite different from recording an interview.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >&gt;&gt; Blue Screen VS Green Screen: All You Need to Know <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Shoot-IGTV-Videos-With-a-DSLR-Camera-2"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-IGTV-Videos-With-a-DSLR-Camera-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot IGTV Videos With a DSLR Camera?"></a>How to Shoot IGTV Videos With a DSLR Camera?</h2><p>Learning how to operate a DLSR camera takes time and practice, so in order to capture professional-looking videos, you need to use the camera as often as you can. Adjusting the exposure value or pulling focus manually may seem difficult when you first start producing videos, but learning how to do these things will make you a better cinematographer, and it will enable you to create brilliant content for your IGTV channel.</p><p>All you need to do when recording a video for IGTV is to <strong>turn your camera horizontally</strong>, in order to capture the video in the <strong>aspect ratio that matches the aspect ratio supported by the IGTV platform</strong>. Keep in mind that videos are commonly recorded in the landscape format and that you should only shoot vertical videos if you want to upload them to a platform like IGTV that only lets its users upload videos in the portrait format.</p><p>Unlike smartphones, DSLR cameras allow you to <strong>change the lens</strong>, which enables you to create a certain visual style by simply using a lens with a different focal length. In most cases, you’ll want to use a <strong>standard 18-55mm lens</strong> to record your IGTV videos because this type of lens can be used for a wide variety of different scenes. <strong>Ultra-wide lenses</strong> can create an entertaining effect by distorting the space depicted in the video, and they are often used to create video content for social media platforms.</p><p>Shooting videos on DSLR cameras also mean that you need access to a <strong>video editing software</strong>, because the raw footage often contains parts you don’t want to include in the final cut of your video. Professional video editing software products like <strong>Final Cut Pro or Premiere Pro</strong> may be too challenging for inexperienced video editors, and if you are still learning the ropes of the trade you should try using a less demanding video editing app for Mac and PC computers like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FUS.html" >PowerDirector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The editing room is where your next IGTV video is going to get its final form, and you shouldn’t skip this step of the video production process just because it is time-consuming. If you want to impress your audience on IGTV you should work slowly and relentlessly on your footage until you are perfectly happy with the result.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>You don’t have to be a professional in order to record an IGTV video, but you still need to have at least basic knowledge about how cameras work and how you can use them to create vertical videos.
