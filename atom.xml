Many people are trying to become influencers on Instagram daily. To do that, they have to keep the check on their followers’ counts. No one wants their follower count to decrease. But if that happens, then you would like to know who has unfollowed you. There are many ways to check it, but the most basic form of how to see who unfollowed you on Instagram is by inspecting manually. The following steps can assist you in that:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Launch the app</strong></p><p>First things first, you have to launch the Instagram app or website on your phone or on a computer.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Check the following</strong></p><p>Now, look at the following box in the profile of the person you want to check manually. If you don’t see your profile in the <strong>Following tab</strong>, then you can assume that they have unfollowed you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-following-list.jpg"                      alt="Instagram following list"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Search the name</strong></p><p>Go to the <strong>Search bar</strong> and search the person by that person’s username.

These followers are somehow interested in your personality, posts, or what you show on your Instagram account. So, if you are an Instagram influencer, you would want to prevent people from unfollowing you. The best is by maintaining their expectations and hopes with your account. The following tips can assist you in preventing organic followers from unfollowing:</p><ul><li><strong>Going Live</strong></li></ul><p>One of the most effective ways is going live on Instagram to know what people expect from you. You can let your followers see the real you to maintain an excellent relationship with them.</p><ul><li><strong>Stay Active</strong></li></ul><p>If you are not staying active for whatever reason, there’s a high chance people will start unfollowing you. You need to keep your feed presence by posting more often to prevent the organic followers from unfollowing you.</p><ul><li><strong>Engage with audience</strong></li></ul><p>Start engaging with your follower, reply to their comments on your posts with interactive stickers. Otherwise, they would think that you are rude and will start unfollowing you. Also, try to engage on their posts as well.</p><h3 id="FAQs-about-Instagram-Followers-Tracking"><a href="#FAQs-about-Instagram-Followers-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="FAQs about Instagram Followers Tracking"></a>FAQs about Instagram Followers Tracking</h3><h4 id="1-Are-you-notified-if-someone-unfollows-you-on-Instagram"><a href="#1-Are-you-notified-if-someone-unfollows-you-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="1.

But if you still want to know, you can either check manually or use a third-party app.</p><h4 id="2-Is-it-immature-to-unfollow-someone-on-Instagram"><a href="#2-Is-it-immature-to-unfollow-someone-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="2.

If you don’t want to interact with someone or see their posts or stories, then it is mature to unfollow them for good. But to unfollow people for fun, then it is pretty immature.</p><h4 id="3-How-do-I-stop-a-follower-from-seeing-my-Instagram-posts"><a href="#3-How-do-I-stop-a-follower-from-seeing-my-Instagram-posts" class="headerlink" title="3.

It is a great place to share your photos and videos to build your social networking. And when you are connected daily to your new fans on Instagram, music adding-on is an integral part of it. Appropriate music can convey your feelings or mobilize the audience’s emotions.</p><p>However, you must understand its music copyright rules before sharing your tunes.</p><p>This article will give you a comprehensive guide to understanding Instagram’s rules about copyright music. We’ll also discuss a few tips for staying compliant and avoiding any potential copyright issues.</p><h2 id="How-Does-Instagram-Detect-Copyright-Music"><a href="#How-Does-Instagram-Detect-Copyright-Music" class="headerlink" title="How Does Instagram Detect Copyright Music?"></a>How Does Instagram Detect Copyright Music?</h2><p>Firstly, let’s look into the background of Instagram’s working mechanism for copyright music detection.</p><p>Instagram has an automated system that generally detects copyrighted content in user posts, live shows, or IGTV. Even though the procedure is automated, mistakes can still occur; however, this wouldn’t stop the platform from taking down posts or videos entirely from user profiles.</p><p>Instagram’s recently improved copyright infringement detection system now detects copyrighted music in content. The service sends a pop-up notification to the users, which gives them time to either stop using the track or change it in their posts.</p><p>If the system detects copyrighted content, here’s what happens to your Instagram account:</p><ul><li>Your post may be muted on Instagram.</li><li>Instagram notifies you to take the track down if you’re broadcasting a track during a Livestream.</li><li>Instagram may take down your post entirely.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/instagram-copyright-notification.png"                      alt="instagram copyright notification"                ></p><h2 id="Instagram-Music-Copyright-Rules"><a href="#Instagram-Music-Copyright-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Music Copyright Rules"></a>Instagram Music Copyright Rules</h2><p>After knowing how Instagram detects copyrighted music and the results of being involved with music copyright issues, you may wonder how to avoid the risks.</p><p>Below are the three general copyright principles you should keep in mind when using music on Instagram:</p><ul><li><strong>Apply A Video When Sharing Music:</strong> Instagram allows you to share a recording of an artist or band performing live and applying music to a short video.</li><li><strong>Keep The Video Short:</strong> Make sure your video is short. Instagram’s detection system will limit your content if you post a more extended clip with copyrighted music.</li><li><strong>Unlimited Music For Your Instagram Stories:</strong> If you share a story on Instagram, the platform allows you to add unlimited copyrighted music from its built-in music library.</li></ul><h2 id="How-To-Use-Copyright-Music-On-Instagram"><a href="#How-To-Use-Copyright-Music-On-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How To Use Copyright Music On Instagram"></a>How To Use Copyright Music On Instagram</h2><p>Under Instagram’s automated detection system and copyright music rules, using copyrighted music is very important to ensure everything is right for your Instagram content.</p><p>In this part, we will focus on using royalty-free music on Instagram.

They are a great way to categorize and eternalize your stories on the feed for your audience to enjoy repeatedly. <strong>Creating Instagram highlight covers</strong> is a great way to build your brand and make your profile stand out. Moreover, you can customize your highlight covers with patterns, colors, and graphics to add to the overall aesthetic. However, the question is, how to make Instagram highlight covers?</p><p>No worries, here in this article, we will walk you through each step on how to create Instagram highlight covers.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Instagram-Highlight-Cover-Size-and-Dimensions"><a href="#Part-1-Instagram-Highlight-Cover-Size-and-Dimensions" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Instagram Highlight Cover Size and Dimensions"></a>Part 1: Instagram Highlight Cover Size and Dimensions</h2><p>The highlight covers are small. Thus, it is vital to have the correct size and dimensions. Creating highlight covers with proper width and height ensures that you do not have to crop any of your designs.</p><p>Generally, the Instagram highlight covers dimensions are the same as Insta stories, that is, 1080 pixels by 1920 pixels or a 9:16 aspect ratio. We recommend using square 1:1 dimensions when designing your custom highlight covers with high pixels as they work well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-instagram-highlight.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Instagram highlight "                ></p><p>When designing custom highlight covers on Canva, you will notice that the icon will be in the middle of a story-size rectangle. The overall aspect ratio to make highlight covers in Canva is 9:16. However, ensure that that the illustration is centered when you add it as your Instagram highlight icon.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-Instagram-Highlight-Cover-on-Canva"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-Instagram-Highlight-Cover-on-Canva" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Make Instagram Highlight Cover on Canva?"></a>Part 2: How to Make Instagram Highlight Cover on Canva?</h2><p>Instagram allows you to use just about any image you like for your highlight covers. However, if you want your brand to stand out among the competition, you must get past just any image. Highlight covers are a prime space to attract visitors, turn them into customers, and leave a lasting impression. So, make the best use of it by creating custom highlight covers.</p><p>There are many photo editors you can use for Instagram highlight cover and creating great-looking Instagram highlight covers is super easy with the free online tool Canva.</p><p>Here is a step-by-step guide to follow on how to make highlight covers using the tool</p><p><strong>Step 1: Head over to canva.com or download the Canva App</strong></p><p>Once you are on the website, create your free account if you do not have one, and then log into your account.

Incorporating your brand’s assets is an excellent way to make your highlights feel more professional. You can include your brand voice and style. Or go with the colors, fonts, or design trademarks that you use on other channels.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Creating Instagram Highlight Covers is a quick and easy way to maintain your brand aesthetic and get more views.

It is a great place to share your photos and videos to build your social networking. And when you are connected daily to your new fans on Instagram, music adding-on is an integral part of it. Appropriate music can convey your feelings or mobilize the audience’s emotions.</p><p>However, you must understand its music copyright rules before sharing your tunes.</p><p>This article will give you a comprehensive guide to understanding Instagram’s rules about copyright music. We’ll also discuss a few tips for staying compliant and avoiding any potential copyright issues.</p><h2 id="How-Does-Instagram-Detect-Copyright-Music"><a href="#How-Does-Instagram-Detect-Copyright-Music" class="headerlink" title="How Does Instagram Detect Copyright Music?"></a>How Does Instagram Detect Copyright Music?</h2><p>Firstly, let’s look into the background of Instagram’s working mechanism for copyright music detection.</p><p>Instagram has an automated system that generally detects copyrighted content in user posts, live shows, or IGTV. Even though the procedure is automated, mistakes can still occur; however, this wouldn’t stop the platform from taking down posts or videos entirely from user profiles.</p><p>Instagram’s recently improved copyright infringement detection system now detects copyrighted music in content. The service sends a pop-up notification to the users, which gives them time to either stop using the track or change it in their posts.</p><p>If the system detects copyrighted content, here’s what happens to your Instagram account:</p><ul><li>Your post may be muted on Instagram.</li><li>Instagram notifies you to take the track down if you’re broadcasting a track during a Livestream.</li><li>Instagram may take down your post entirely.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/instagram-copyright-notification.png"                      alt="instagram copyright notification"                ></p><h2 id="Instagram-Music-Copyright-Rules"><a href="#Instagram-Music-Copyright-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Music Copyright Rules"></a>Instagram Music Copyright Rules</h2><p>After knowing how Instagram detects copyrighted music and the results of being involved with music copyright issues, you may wonder how to avoid the risks.</p><p>Below are the three general copyright principles you should keep in mind when using music on Instagram:</p><ul><li><strong>Apply A Video When Sharing Music:</strong> Instagram allows you to share a recording of an artist or band performing live and applying music to a short video.</li><li><strong>Keep The Video Short:</strong> Make sure your video is short. Instagram’s detection system will limit your content if you post a more extended clip with copyrighted music.</li><li><strong>Unlimited Music For Your Instagram Stories:</strong> If you share a story on Instagram, the platform allows you to add unlimited copyrighted music from its built-in music library.</li></ul><h2 id="How-To-Use-Copyright-Music-On-Instagram"><a href="#How-To-Use-Copyright-Music-On-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How To Use Copyright Music On Instagram"></a>How To Use Copyright Music On Instagram</h2><p>Under Instagram’s automated detection system and copyright music rules, using copyrighted music is very important to ensure everything is right for your Instagram content.</p><p>In this part, we will focus on using royalty-free music on Instagram.

Being a video content creator means that you should always have a fresh source of ideas for your next video, but at times we all simply run out of ideas. This is only natural, and if you find yourself facing a creative block you shouldn’t panic. Make yourself a cup of tea instead, make yourself comfortable and read on because in this article we are going to take you through ten awesome ideas you can use to create brilliant IGTV videos in 2024.</p><h2 id="10-Amazing-IGTV-Video-Ideas-You-Can-Try-in-2024"><a href="#10-Amazing-IGTV-Video-Ideas-You-Can-Try-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="10 Amazing IGTV Video Ideas You Can Try in 2024"></a>10 Amazing IGTV Video Ideas You Can Try in 2024</h2><p>Before we proceed any further, it is worth noting that IGTV only supports vertically oriented videos, and the content you create for your channel on this platform must meet its requirements. However, IGTV lets you share your videos on other social media, so your followers can always be up to date with your latest posts. Okay, let’s have a look at some ideas for IGTV videos you can try this year.</p><h4 id="1-Q-A-Videos-Answer-the-Questions-Your-Followers-Have-Asked"><a href="#1-Q-A-Videos-Answer-the-Questions-Your-Followers-Have-Asked" class="headerlink" title="1. Q &amp; A Videos: Answer the Questions Your Followers Have Asked"></a>1. Q &amp; A Videos: Answer the Questions Your Followers Have Asked</h4><p>Establishing a strong connection with the people who follow your IGTV channel should be one of your top priorities. Q&amp;A videos offer a perfect opportunity to strengthen that bond since you can let your followers ask you questions in the comments of the post you share on your Instagram profile or via Instagram stories and then create an IGTV video that answers the most interesting questions. This is a great way to show your knowledge in a certain area or to provide your followers with useful information about a given topic. The best part is that Q&amp;A videos are remarkably easy to create, so you won’t even need a pricey camera to record this type of video.</p><h4 id="2-Workout-Routine-Fitness-Videos-Never-Go-Out-of-Fashion"><a href="#2-Workout-Routine-Fitness-Videos-Never-Go-Out-of-Fashion" class="headerlink" title="2. Workout Routine: Fitness Videos Never Go Out of Fashion"></a>2. Workout Routine: Fitness Videos Never Go Out of Fashion</h4><p>Millions of people exercise at home, but quite a few of them still don’t have their routine. If you are a fitness or sports professional with tons of experience who knows a number of different workout routines you should consider creating IGTV videos that explain each exercise. Speeding up the video can be practical as it shortens its duration, but it can also help you create a more visually dynamic and entertaining video. In case some exercises in the video should be repeated more than once you can add text, so the viewers can know exactly how many times they should repeat each exercise during the workout.</p><h4 id="3-Reveal-a-Part-of-The-Atmosphere-on-the-Set-of-Your-New-IGTV-Video"><a href="#3-Reveal-a-Part-of-The-Atmosphere-on-the-Set-of-Your-New-IGTV-Video" class="headerlink" title="3. Reveal a Part of The Atmosphere on the Set of Your New IGTV Video"></a>3. Reveal a Part of The Atmosphere on the Set of Your New IGTV Video</h4><p>Recording a new video is always exciting, and the atmosphere on the set can at times be electrifying. If you manage to tap into that energy and share it with your followers, you’ll spark curiosity and build up the anticipation of your next post on IGTV. Furthermore, sharing a sneak peek from the set will make your followers feel involved in the process of making the video and it will provide them with the opportunity to share their opinions with you in the comments. Even a funny moment at the office can serve as a behind the scenes video that you can use if you temporarily run out of ideas.</p><h4 id="4-Tell-Your-Followers-What-Your-Customers-are-Saying-About-Your-Products"><a href="#4-Tell-Your-Followers-What-Your-Customers-are-Saying-About-Your-Products" class="headerlink" title="4. Tell Your Followers What Your Customers are Saying About Your Products"></a>4. Tell Your Followers What Your Customers are Saying About Your Products</h4><p>A satisfied customer is the best source of advertisement you can possibly get, and you shouldn’t hesitate to share the positive feedback with your followers on IGTV. These videos are remarkably easy to make since you can just combine a few shots of the person who left the feedback with the text. However, making the customer testimonial videos seem authentic is somewhat difficult, because you may have a tough time persuading your audience that the person in the video is not an actor or that the words you used in the video are actually theirs.</p><h4 id="5-Share-the-Ingredients-of-Your-Favorite-Recipes"><a href="#5-Share-the-Ingredients-of-Your-Favorite-Recipes" class="headerlink" title="5. Share the Ingredients of Your Favorite Recipes"></a>5. Share the Ingredients of Your Favorite Recipes</h4><p>Everyone loves food, but from time to time we all find ourselves completely out of ideas when it comes to our next meal. So, if you are already a successful food blogger, you can extend your presence on social media by creating IGTV videos that show the viewer how to prepare a certain dish. You can share your own recipes with the audience or you can show your followers how to prepare meals from different world cuisines. You can use the text to give detailed instructions about each step of the process to the viewers of the video or to share the entire list of ingredients with them.</p><h4 id="6-Start-a-New-Web-Series-on-IGTV"><a href="#6-Start-a-New-Web-Series-on-IGTV" class="headerlink" title="6. Start a New Web Series on IGTV"></a>6. Start a New Web Series on IGTV</h4><p>Some ideas are simply too complex to be covered in a single video, as their stories demand time to be properly told. In case you have such an idea you should consider producing a web series that can have as few as three or as many as ten episodes, depending on how much material you have. Keep in mind that producing a web series requires a significant amount of preparation because you are going to need a script for each episode, which is why you are going to have to develop the idea before you can actually start filming it.</p><h4 id="7-Create-Tutorials-and-How-to-Videos"><a href="#7-Create-Tutorials-and-How-to-Videos" class="headerlink" title="7. Create Tutorials and How to Videos"></a>7. Create Tutorials and How to Videos</h4><p>Sharing knowledge can be rewarding in so many different ways, and it can help you come up with authentic ideas for videos your followers on IGTV are going to enjoy watching. Producing makeup and hairdo tutorials or explaining how a product works is an excellent idea if you know enough about these topics and if you feel confident enough to show your followers how they can look ravishing or how they can use a camera, a software or any other product. Which type of tutorials and how to videos you can create depends largely on your area of expertise, so choose only the topics you know a lot about.</p><h4 id="8-Review-Videos-Review-a-Book-a-Restaurant-or-a-Movie"><a href="#8-Review-Videos-Review-a-Book-a-Restaurant-or-a-Movie" class="headerlink" title="8. Review Videos: Review a Book, a Restaurant or a Movie"></a>8. Review Videos: Review a Book, a Restaurant or a Movie</h4><p>Culture can serve as an endless source of ideas. Reviewing movies, books or restaurants can be a great way to introduce a certain culture to the people who follow you on IGTV. Japanese cuisine, cinema, and literature, for example, are so rich that you can dedicate your entire channel to them. The same is true for all great cultures of the world, but keep in mind that reviewing a book or movie may be a lot harder than it seems because it requires an impressive level of knowledge about art and culture in general.</p><h4 id="9-Unboxing-videos-Unbox-Gifts"><a href="#9-Unboxing-videos-Unbox-Gifts" class="headerlink" title="9. Unboxing videos: Unbox Gifts"></a>9. Unboxing videos: Unbox Gifts</h4><p>There is something strangely satisfying about watching others open gifts or things they got in the mail. This type of video is already quite popular among bloggers who also have an IGTV channel since they allow them to provide a link to their blog where they can review a particular product in more detail or provide pictures. In addition, posting this type of content on your IGTV channel can open up opportunities for sponsorships from brands in need of influential bloggers and Instagrammers who are willing to promote their products.</p><h4 id="10-What’s-on-my-Phone-videos-and-Capture-Screen-Recordings"><a href="#10-What’s-on-my-Phone-videos-and-Capture-Screen-Recordings" class="headerlink" title="10. What’s on my Phone videos and Capture Screen Recordings"></a>10. What’s on my Phone videos and Capture Screen Recordings</h4><p>New apps emerge at an astounding rate, while a lot of iPhone and Android users are still having trouble figuring out how to use simple social media apps like Facebook, Instagram or IGTV. That’s why recording the screen of your phone while using an app can be a great idea for an IGTV video. You can introduce your followers to new apps, or show them the advanced options of a popular app in your phones. You can record any activity on your phone you want, but you should only upload screen recordings to your IGTV channel that fit its general theme.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Despite the fact that all IGTV users can upload videos that last up to ten minutes to their channels, it is still better to keep the videos you share on your IGTV channel short and on point because the attention span of social media users can be quite short. Hopefully some of the ideas we shared with you in this article are going to help you find inspiration for your next IGTV video. Which idea did you like the most?

One of the best ways to do that is by using a reliable <strong>Instagram grid maker</strong>. For instance, with an Instagram grid planner, you can come up with an overall theme for your profile or connect various posts via a puzzle. To help you elevate the creative and visual appeal of your profile, I’m going to make you familiar with the 10 best grid makers for Instagram.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What are Instagram Grids All About?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: The 6 Best Online Grid Makers for Instagram</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Top 4 Grid Makers for Instagram [for Android and iOS]</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Make an Appealing Photo Grid on Instagram?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Creative Ideas to Implement Instagram Grid Layouts</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Instagram-Grids-All-About"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Instagram-Grids-All-About" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Instagram Grids All About?"></a>Part 1: What are Instagram Grids All About?</h2><p>You might already know that Instagram displays our posts in a 3-column layout. Therefore, to make the most of this layout, a lot of people work on the overall 3x3 grid (3 rows and 3 columns).</p><p>To catch the attention of their audience, you can come up with an overall theme for your profile using 9 posts (a 3x3 grid). For instance, you can see here is a perfect example of a puzzle grid in which some parts of a post are overlapping on the adjacent posts. This would make the overall profile look uniform and more aesthetically pleasing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/what-are-instagram-grids.jpg"                      alt="what are instagram grids"                ></p><p>Just like this, there can be so many ways in which we can plan the layout of a grid for our Instagram profile.</p><h2 id="Part-2-The-6-Best-Online-Grid-Makers-for-Instagram"><a href="#Part-2-The-6-Best-Online-Grid-Makers-for-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: The 6 Best Online Grid Makers for Instagram"></a>Part 2: The 6 Best Online Grid Makers for Instagram</h2><p>In case you are also looking for an online Instagram grid maker, then you can simply explore these options:</p><h4 id="1-My-Social-Boutique"><a href="#1-My-Social-Boutique" class="headerlink" title="1.My Social Boutique"></a>1.<a class="link"   href="https://mysocialboutique.co/" >My Social Boutique <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>If you are looking for free or paid Instagram grid templates, then you can head to My Social Boutique.

For instance, to get a 3x3 Instagram grid layout, you can set the number of columns and rows as 3.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/choose-how-split-image.jpg"                      alt="choose how split image"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Split your image and save all photos</strong></p><p>After setting a preferred ratio for the grid, you can also select a respective image format to export your files (like JPG or PNG). In the end, just click on the “Split Image” button and wait as the application would split your photos in a specific ratio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/split-image-save-photo.jpg"                      alt="split image save photo"                ></p><p>When the process is completed, the online grid maker for Instagram will let you know.

It might attract your audience, but you need to maintain a consistent appeal throughout your profile. To do that, you need to ensure that all the upcoming posts would follow the same pattern and appeal.</p><h4 id="Align-it-with-your-brand’s-vision"><a href="#Align-it-with-your-brand’s-vision" class="headerlink" title="Align it with your brand’s vision"></a>Align it with your brand’s vision</h4><p>Don’t come up with a grid layout for Instagram just for the sake of it. You need to make sure that it is aligned with the overall look and feel of your brand. Also, your Instagram page should remain authentic with the message of your brand and its image.</p><h4 id="Focus-on-color-combinations"><a href="#Focus-on-color-combinations" class="headerlink" title="Focus on color combinations"></a>Focus on color combinations</h4><p>Just splitting your images into a 3x3 grid is not enough.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> The Kensun Portable Tire Inflator made a good showing when we tested it. It gets high marks for accuracy, portability, and convenience, but it does fall down in some areas such as storing the air hose and power cable. Nevertheless, it’s a handy, nifty device that delivers the air you need when you need it.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Maximum-portability-but-not-maximum-flexibility"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Maximum-portability-but-not-maximum-flexibility" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Maximum portability, but not maximum flexibility"></a><strong>Design and Features: Maximum portability, but not maximum flexibility</strong></h2><p> The form factor of the Kensun Portable Tire Inflator is a case study in maximum portability. It weighs a mere 5 pounds, and the sturdy handle makes it easy to pick up and move around. Moreover, at 11.8 inches long, 4.3 inches wide and 6.7 inches tall, it’s quite compact. And it’s hard plastic casing means it can withstand some punishment and still deliver top performance.</p><p> Unlike other portable air compressors that draw their power from your car’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/car-cigarette-lighter-12v-socket-534754" >12V socket <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (cigarette lighter) or directly from the battery, the Kensun Portable Tire Inflator gives you the option of connecting it to a standard wall outlet. This makes it a very nice item to have in your garage or basement for the occasion where you have to fill up items such as sporting equipment, party balloons, and inflatable swimming pools.</p><p> The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-liquid-crystal-display-lcd-2625913" >digital LCD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is small—just 2 inches—but it gives an at-a-glance view of all the info you need to operate the pump. It’s nice, bright, and can be read both in direct sunlight and on dark nights. It displays pressure in PSI (pounds per square inch), BAR (atmospheric pressure), and kPA (kilopascal). If you’re going to use this pump mainly with American cars, you might never use units other than PSI, but it’s very convenient if you ever need to measure pressure in metric or SI (International System of Units).</p><p> The digital LCD is small—just 2 inches—but it gives an at-a-glance view of all the info you need to operate the pump.</p><p> The maximum PSI of this portable tire inflator is 90 PSI. This is more than enough to inflate your car tires, sports equipment, and anything else you need. Most car and truck tires have a recommended PSI between 30 and 32 PSI. The Kensun will get the job done, but other car air compressors we tested can reach a maximum of up to 150 PSI.</p><p> This car tire inflator only has a 21-inch air-hose. So you’ll need to place it less than two feet away from the tire you want to inflate. The 10.9-foot power cord gives you some range, but a good deal of it will be running from your dashboard and out your car window. This is about the same hose length you can expect similar products, but it pales in comparison to the Viair 88P Portable Compressor which has a 16-foot air hose.</p><p> The integrated flashlight on the Kensun Portable Tire Inflator is pretty bright and illuminates the pump’s working area well. This also makes it more visible to passing cars if you happened to be filling up on the side of the road late at night.</p><p> One of the more annoying aspects of this portable air compressor is how it stores its cords while not in use. Both the air-hose and 12V adapter cord share one big compartment in the bottom of the pump. This would be fine if there was a clear way to fit them in there. When we received our test unit, we were surprised to see that it looked like the power cord was jammed in with no cable management at all.</p><p> When you do finally get it wrapped up, the pump fits nicely in its included carrying case. It’s made of gore-tex, a fairly durable material, so it can take the punishment of being stored long-term in your trunk, and it’s compact enough that it won’t take up much room.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1531879">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531879.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1531879">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531879.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1531879%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1531879/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-T-minus-one-minute"><a href="#Setup-Process-T-minus-one-minute" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: T-minus one minute"></a><strong>Setup Process: T-minus one minute</strong></h2><p> Once you’ve read the user manual, you’ll know how to use the Kensun portable tire inflator. Nevertheless, you’ll want to do some test runs before you take it on the road. During our testing phase, we timed how long it takes from getting out of the car to the pump inflating one of our tires. It took about one minute, which is good time if you’re on the side of the highway with an unexpected flat.</p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jeffrey Daniel Chadwick</p><h2 id="Performance-Reliable-accurate-quick-and-loud"><a href="#Performance-Reliable-accurate-quick-and-loud" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Reliable, accurate, quick and loud"></a><strong>Performance: Reliable, accurate, quick and loud</strong></h2><p> When we tested the tire inflator, we took it on a road trip that took us to the states of Nevada, Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming. Along the way, we stopped at rural rest areas and gas stations. In order to use them in the circumstances, they were designed for. Throughout it all, the Kensun Portable Tire Inflator never failed to work when we needed it.</p><p> We timed how long it took the air compressor to inflate back up to the recommended pressure and got an average of 1 minute, 50 seconds.</p><p> We deflated all four tires on our 2014 Kia Rio to 20 PSI—the recommended PSI for that model is 32 PSI, meaning 20 PSI was dangerously low to drive on. We timed how long it took the air compressor to inflate back up to the recommended pressure and got an average of 1 minute, 50 seconds.</p><p> This is a bit longer than the average fill time of the other models we tested like the Viair 88P Portable Compressor pump, which consistently filled our tires in under a minute.</p><p> Any portable tire inflator you use will generate a good deal of noise. Using a decibel meter, we measured how loud this compressor gets while it’s in use. The highest level we recorded was 90 decibels, but it usually hovered at about 88 decibels. That’s not loud enough to damage your hearing, but you’ll have to step away if you want to take a phone call.</p><p> The accuracy was the best of all the air compressors we tested. We compared the air pressure on the digital display with that of a plain pencil-style tire pressure gauge. We found that it was consistently accurate to within a 5 PSI range. Four times more accurate than the 2 PSI range we observed on some other inflators.</p><p> This air compressor can run for about half an hour before you have to cycle it down, and given how quickly it inflates your tires, you’re unlikely to use it that long. However, if you’re using it to inflate multiple objects or larger items, you’ll have to take a periodic break while it cools down.</p><p> This air compressor can run for about half an hour before you have to cycle it down, and given how quickly it inflates your tires, you’re unlikely to use it that long.</p><p> One of the most convenient things about this portable air pump is its auto-shutdown feature. This allows you to select the precise tire pressure you want before you start pumping. Once the tire is inflated to the desired pressure, it shuts down. This means that you don’t have to babysit the pump while it’s going, and all but guarantees that you won’t over-inflate your tires.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148644/16836" target="_top" id="2148644">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148644" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148644/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-A-decent-buy-considering-its-versatility"><a href="#Price-A-decent-buy-considering-its-versatility" class="headerlink" title="Price: A decent buy considering its versatility"></a><strong>Price: A decent buy considering its versatility</strong></h2><p> The Kensun Portable Tire Inflator has an MSRP of $80 on Amazon, which is a good price for what you get. It’s not nearly as affordable as some budget models we’ve seen, such as the Audew Portable Air Compressor Pump, which will only run you $40, but it gives you the convenience of not having to be tethered to your car to inflate something.</p><h2 id="Kensun-Portable-Tire-Inflator-vs-Jaco-Digital-Tire-Inflator"><a href="#Kensun-Portable-Tire-Inflator-vs-Jaco-Digital-Tire-Inflator" class="headerlink" title="Kensun Portable Tire Inflator vs. Jaco Digital Tire Inflator"></a><strong>Kensun Portable Tire Inflator vs. Jaco Digital Tire Inflator</strong></h2><p> The Kensun Portable Tire Inflator is similar to the Jaco Digital Tire Inflator, they have similar cord and hose lengths, and can continually run for about half an hour. But the Kensun is more than twice the size of the Jaco, so it can deliver more power to fill your tires faster. Additionally, the Jaco lacks the ability to plug into an AC socket, so you can only use it in your car.</p><p> But the Jaco does offer some benefits the Kensun doesn’t. Its built-in light is just as bright as the Kensun’s, but it also has the ability to flash hazard signals for oncoming traffic, and even put out an SOS in Morse Code in the event of real emergencies. Plus, its small form factor makes it much easier to put away and store.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/jaco-smartpro-digital-tire-inflator-review-4776811" >Jaco SmartPro Digital Tire Inflator Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>A portable tire inflator that can work well in a car or at home.</strong></p><p> The Kensun Portable Tire Inflator is a great choice to keep in your truck, garage, or wherever you keep your “just-in-case” supplies. It’s a device that is as necessary for drivers as jumper cables and an emergency flashlight. You can count on it to be reliable when you need it, and fill your tires quickly and accurately. Plus, the added benefit of being able to plug it into your wall can’t be overstated. It has its foibles, but in the grand scheme of things, they’re minor inconveniences.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  AC&#x2F;DC Portable Air Pump Tire Inflator</li><li>Product Brand  Kensun</li><li>Price  $79.99</li><li>Release Date  July 2016</li><li>Weight  5 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  11.8 x 4.3 x 6.7 in.</li><li>Warranty  2 Years</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-nailing-instagram-aesthetics-tips-for-video-dimensions-for-2024/"><u>[New] Nailing Instagram Aesthetics Tips for Video Dimensions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-unveiling-the-top-10-video-editing-apps-for-instagram-magic/"><u>[New] Unveiling the Top 10 Video Editing Apps for Instagram Magic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-digital-footprints-on-instagram-effective-photo-watermarking/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Digital Footprints on Instagram Effective Photo Watermarking</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-rotational-realities-how-to-captivate-with-instagrams-sideways-videos/"><u>[Updated] Rotational Realities How to Captivate with Instagram's Sideways Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-instagram-snapshot-of-an-enlightening-episode/"><u>2024 Approved Instagram Snapshot of an Enlightening Episode</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-introduction-to-dynamic-graphic-techniques/"><u>2024 Approved Introduction to Dynamic Graphic Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://network-issues.techidaily.com/error-12-discontinued-hunter-realm-saved/"><u>Error 12 Discontinued, Hunter Realm Saved</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-change-gps-location-on-apple-iphone-6-easily-and-safely-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How to Change GPS Location on Apple iPhone 6 Easily & Safely | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-swift-steps-to-personalize-your-in-game-sonic-presence-in-pubg/"><u>In 2024, Swift Steps to Personalize Your In-Game Sonic Presence in PUBG</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/reroute-mac-screenshot-file-destination-for-2024/"><u>Reroute Mac Screenshot File Destination for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://technical-tips.techidaily.com/windows-10-october-2018-update-file-missing-issue-solved/"><u>Windows 10 October 2018 Update File Missing Issue [SOLVED]</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The vast majority of people who can see your IGTV posts will be viewing them from a mobile device, which is why your content has to be mobile-friendly. Subtitles should be included in all videos you post on IGTV since they will make your videos more accessible to people with hearing impairment as well as to those IGTV users who for whatever reason can’t turn on the sound while they are watching your video. Read on if you would like to find out how you can add subtitles to IGTV videos because in this article we are going to show you how you can accomplish this effortlessly.</p><h2 id="Add-Subtitles-to-IGTV-Videos-from-Mac-and-PC-Computers-Using-Filmora"><a href="#Add-Subtitles-to-IGTV-Videos-from-Mac-and-PC-Computers-Using-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Add Subtitles to IGTV Videos from Mac and PC Computers Using Filmora"></a>Add Subtitles to IGTV Videos from Mac and PC Computers Using Filmora</h2><p>IGTV videos are vertically oriented, so you can’t just create an SRT file that contains the subtitles. The subtitles for IGTV videos have to be hardcoded. This means that the subtitles are going to be an integral part of the video and that you have to add them to the video during the post-production process.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p>We are going to show you how to add subtitles to videos in Filmora because you don’t have to be an experienced filmmaker in order to use this video editing software. After installing Filmora on your Mac or PC computer, double-click on its desktop icon to launch it. The welcome window will appear on the screen asking you if you want to continue working on a <strong>recent project</strong> or if you want to create a <strong>new project</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/new-project-9.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora0 Create New Project"                ></p><p>Choose the <strong>New Project</strong> option and then once the project opens, head over to <strong>File menu</strong> and select <strong>Project Settings</strong> from the list. The <strong>Project Settings window</strong> will pop up on the screen and you should change the resolution to <strong>1080x1920 (9:16)</strong> and increase the <strong>Frame Rate to 30fps</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-4k-project-settings.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora0 Create New Project"                ></p><p>Click on the <strong>OK button</strong> to confirm the changes, and then go to the <strong>Media panel</strong> to import the video you would like to edit. The fastest way to add media files to your project is to just drag them from the folder in which they are stored and drop them to the Media panel. You can also click on the <strong>Import</strong> drop-down menu and select the <strong>Import Media Files</strong> option from the list.</p><p>Place the video file on the timeline, and then return to the <strong>File menu</strong>, and click on the <strong>Preferences</strong> option. Click on the <strong>Editing tab</strong> in the <strong>Preferences window</strong> and make sure that the <strong>Crop to Fit feature</strong> is selected in the <strong>Photo Placement drop-down</strong> menu.</p><p>Click on the <strong>Ok button</strong> to confirm the changes, and then proceed to add the <strong>Basic Blur effect</strong> to the video from the <strong>Background Blur submenu</strong> in the <strong>Effects</strong> panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-background-blur-effects-1.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora0 Create New Project"                ></p><p>You can then cut or trim the video, add filters or perform any other video editing action you want. Keep in mind <strong>that you shouldn’t start adding subtitles before you finish editing your IGTV video.</strong> When you have the final draft of the video ready, you should <strong>make a transcript</strong>. You can do this by exporting the video from Filmora, and uploading it to YouTube in order to automatically create closed captions, but it is much better if you create the transcript manually, because that way you will reduce the chances of making a mistake.</p><p>Once you have all the text ready, you should go to the <strong>Titles panel</strong> and click on the <strong>Subtitles</strong> submenu. Filmora features a huge library of fully customizable subtitles, so you should just pick the option that you like the most and add it to the timeline. Add a subtitle file to the exact location on the timeline where particular words are said, and then double-click on it to start adding the text to your IGTV video. Keep in mind that you are going to have to go through the same process for each new sentence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-titles-text.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora0 Create New Project"                ></p><p>You can choose from a variety of preset text styles, and you can select the font, color or the size of the text. Click on the <strong>Advanced button</strong> if you would like to customize the text and create as many text layers as you need to cover all the dialogues or the narration in the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/advanced-text-editing-9-win.jpg"                      alt=" Filmora0 Create New Project"                ></p><p>Adding subtitles to a video can be a painstakingly long process if you’re working with a lot of text, so arm yourself with patience and do your best to be as precise as you possibly can, because lagging subtitles can create a lot of confusion. Besides adding the title and text, you can add some animation effects such as typewriter animation to the typed texts.

Export the video and proceed to upload it to IGTV from your web browser or from your phone.</p><h2 id="How-to-Add-Text-to-IGTV-Videos-with-the-Quik-App-For-iOS-and-Android-Devices"><a href="#How-to-Add-Text-to-IGTV-Videos-with-the-Quik-App-For-iOS-and-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="How to Add Text to IGTV Videos with the Quik App For iOS and Android Devices"></a>How to Add Text to IGTV Videos with the Quik App For iOS and Android Devices</h2><p>In case you like editing IGTV videos from your phone, you can try adding subtitles to your IGTV videos with the Quik app. After you’ve completed all other video editing tasks, you should tap on the <strong>Text icon</strong> and type in the text you’d like to add to the video. Hit the <strong>OK button</strong> after you’ve added the text and that’s it you’ve successfully created the subtitles for your IGTV video. How long the process of creating hardcoded subtitles is going to last depends on the duration of the video and the amount of narration or dialogue in the video.</p><h2 id="Tips-for-Adding-Subtitles-to-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#Tips-for-Adding-Subtitles-to-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Adding Subtitles to IGTV Videos"></a>Tips for Adding Subtitles to IGTV Videos</h2><p>While adding text to your IGTV you must <strong>pay close attention that the text is clearly visible on the screen</strong> and that the app’s interface isn’t going to cover it once you upload the video to IGTV. Furthermore, <strong>the text color</strong> should match the background so that the viewers can easily read everything that is displayed on the screen**. Avoid placing the text too close to the edges of the frame,** since different phone models have slightly different aspect ratios. As a consequence, your IGTV videos are going to be <strong>cropped</strong>, and parts of the subtitles can be rendered invisible to the audience. That’s why you have to <strong>position the text within the frame carefully</strong> and do your best to overcome the technical limitations imposed by the IGTV platform.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Even though adding subtitles to videos can require a lot of precision and attention to detail, it can help you produce content that attracts a lot of attention on IGTV. However, most videos shared on IGTV don’t surpass a two-minute mark, so even if there is a lot of dialogue, you can add hardcoded subtitles to a video in a relatively short period of time.

A watermark can easily ruin that balance without a good reason since it will hardly prevent someone who decided to steal your work from actually doing it.</p><p><strong>Watermarks are easily removed:</strong> Don’t think for a second that anyone with only a basic level of Photoshop skills, can’t crop or clone stamp a watermark from a photo. Unless you intend to place a watermark over an entire image, like stock photography websites do, but even then removing a watermark is far from impossible.</p><p><strong>You won’t look like a pro:</strong> A watermark will not make you look more professional than you already are, the quality of your photos will. Although photographers sign their prints all the time, a watermark can make you look bad in the eyes of the Instagram’s community because you’ll look like you think that your work is so good that everyone is going to try to steal it. Be humble, there are other ways of proving that you own the copyrights to a photo, like keeping the RAW file safely stored on your computer’s hard-drive or including the copyright information in the photo’s metadata.</p><p><strong>Your photos will look like they’ve been edited:</strong> With all the photo effects Instagram offers and all the photo editing options that are available to photographers, straight-out-of-camera pictures will earn you much more respect from the community on Instagram, than photos that are clearly edited. A watermark can often make people think that the picture has been edited since the photographer took the time to design and add a watermark to a photo.</p><p><strong>Adding watermarks will not make you famous:</strong> At first, it may seem like a good idea to use watermarks for the promotion of your business, but most Instagram users don’t really read the names on the watermarks. Strive to produce photos that will make the viewers want to know everything there is to know about you because the quality of your photos is the best advertisement you can get.</p><h2 id="Watermarking-Instagram-Photos-Tips"><a href="#Watermarking-Instagram-Photos-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Watermarking Instagram Photos - Tips"></a>Watermarking Instagram Photos - Tips</h2><p>If, despite all this, you would still like to add a watermark to your Instagram photos, here are a few tips that will help you avoid making mistakes that can be harmful to the success of your images on Instagram.</p><p><strong>Use monochrome watermarks:</strong> Tastefully designed watermarks, that don’t feature too many colors, will serve its purpose, and they will not distract the viewer of a photo too much. A minimalistic approach to watermark design is probably the best, less is more, so use fewer colors in order to achieve better results.</p><p><strong>Place the watermarks around the edges of a photo:</strong> As we already mentioned, adding new visual elements to photos creates all sorts of problems, but if you really want to watermark your photos, at least try to place them on the edges of a photo where they won’t attract too much attention.</p><p><strong>Vertically oriented watermarks create less distraction:</strong> This is a great way to distract the viewer as little as possible while keeping the watermark on your photo clearly visible and readable. If you place a vertically oriented watermark near the edge of a photo, the spectator has a better chance of seeing a photo, before realizing that it has a watermark.</p><p><strong>Carefully choose the font and its size:</strong> Use simple fonts. There is no reason to utilize kitschy fonts that are not easily readable because it isn’t likely that the viewer of a photo is going to spend time on figuring out what the watermark says. Don’t let the watermark become the first thing your Instagram followers see on a photo because they will most probably just keep scrolling without spending a second to figure out what your photo really is about.</p><h2 id="Best-Apps-You-Can-Use-to-Watermark-Your-Photos"><a href="#Best-Apps-You-Can-Use-to-Watermark-Your-Photos" class="headerlink" title="Best Apps You Can Use to Watermark Your Photos"></a>Best Apps You Can Use to Watermark Your Photos</h2><h4 id="1-eZy-Watermark-Lite"><a href="#1-eZy-Watermark-Lite" class="headerlink" title="1. eZy Watermark Lite"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ezy-watermark-lite-photo/id494473910?mt=8" >eZy Watermark Lite <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ezy-watermark-lite-photo.jpg"                                     ></p><p>More than 2 million downloads prove that eZy Watermark Lite is one of the best iPhone apps for adding watermarks at the App Store.

There has to be some <a class="link"   href="https://animoto.com/blog/business/video-marketing-objectives" >key objective for your Instagram video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p> However, every video may not have a thoughtful or reflective objective because product launches or major announcements and not done each and every week. Whatever the objective of your video is, the moving images must tell a story that the audiences can accept and turn to again and again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/IG-goal.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Video Marketing goals"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Keep-Your-Video-Short"><a href="#Step-2-Keep-Your-Video-Short" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Keep Your Video Short"></a>Step 2: Keep Your Video Short</h3><p> A singular post on Instagram can have up to a 60 minutes long video but, you must keep it <a class="link"   href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/creating-short-snackable-videos-instagram-lindsay-ostrom/" >crisp, interesting, sweet, and short <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. No matter what the video length is, you must ensure that the video must be able to deliver the strong message that it intends to. The primary objective of the video must be to come across clearly without confusing the viewers.</p><p> It is quite possible that your Instagram video marketing content is for introducing a new product. The product can be in a number of colors or have a lot of features. But, that doesn’t mean you have to include it all in a 60-second video. Only add a few features and make the objective of the video clear for the audience to feel connected.</p><p> You may also create several short videos to make the audience understand it easily instead of one long video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/short-video.JPG"                      alt="Instagram Video Marketing short video"                ></p><h3 id="Step-3-Make-High-Quality-Video"><a href="#Step-3-Make-High-Quality-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Make High-Quality Video"></a>Step 3: Make High-Quality Video</h3><p> You must never compromise on the quality of the video when it comes to <a class="link"   href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/04/instagram-videos" >how to make Instagram video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

While posting on Insta stories, you get several fonts to choose or you may <a class="link"   href="https://later.com/blog/instagram-fonts/" >customize it yourself <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by adding your own creativity.</p><p> You may also use the text field templates. Adding the relevant text to your Instagram that is fun and interesting to read as well as informative for your audience can be a great idea for Instagram videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/add-text-ig.jpg"                      alt="Instagram video ideas text"                ></p><h3 id="4-Boomerang"><a href="#4-Boomerang" class="headerlink" title="4.

It is not only fun to create but also adds movement to your Instagram grid.</p><p> When you have no time to post or no ready content, <a class="link"   href="https://help.instagram.com/boomerang/1028997297162413" >making a boomerang videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be a great option to boost your views while still maintaining the superior content that you consistently share.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Boomerang-ig.jpg"                      alt="Instagram video ideas Boomerang"                ></p><h3 id="5-Live-Streaming-An-Event"><a href="#5-Live-Streaming-An-Event" class="headerlink" title="5. Live Streaming An Event"></a>5. Live Streaming An Event</h3><p> When you plan to promote an event, it is important to start it in advance when you have lots of time to plan and focus on it. Creating some of the events focused videos with great captions can be a great way to make an acoustic relation with the prospective visitors in the event and show them what exactly they can expect from you.</p><p> Just posts and images are not enough to promote your event. Live streaming an event can make a larger impact. Your viewers must know that the event cannot be missed out in anyway.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-live-iphone.JPG"                      alt="Instagram video ideas Live Streaming"                ></p><h3 id="6-Video-Slideshow"><a href="#6-Video-Slideshow" class="headerlink" title="6. Video Slideshow"></a>6. Video Slideshow</h3><p> The best part of the slide shows is you do not need any video clips to create it. If you are apprehensive about creating a video, you may just pick a few images and get your way through PowerPoint and make a slideshow.</p><p> The slideshows help in creating list, countdowns, steps, or to show transformation or progress. For instance, the Chevy Trucks video is a great example of slideshows. It has no effects or texts, yet the brand story is reflected through a powerful story.</p><p> If you have any such transformation stories, you may use the journey images to add an emotional story.

Reels is a video feature that allows users to make 15-second multi-clip snaps. You can add various effects, set a time limit for the clip, set the speed, and most importantly, you can also add audio (similar to Instagram Music). It was first launched in Brazil as a trial run and is now available in about 50 countries worldwide. Reels have been extremely successful as people from other such apps, e.g., Tiktok, are attracted towards it. Content creators and brands use it for the promotion and marketing of their products. Moreover, in the lockdown, it has also proved to be a fun and exciting time pass.</p><p><strong>Instagram Stories</strong> - another product of Instagram is also a video-sharing platform. For some of you, you may be wondering which one should you upload your video to. We may be able to help you choose the right platform for you by providing their comparison in the following.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">How to use Instagram Reels?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">How to use Instagram Stories?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Differences between Instagram Reels and Stories</a></li></ul><h2 id="How-to-Use-Instagram-Reels-and-Instagram-Stories"><a href="#How-to-Use-Instagram-Reels-and-Instagram-Stories" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Instagram Reels and Instagram Stories"></a>How to Use Instagram Reels and Instagram Stories</h2><p>Many people get a little confused about making Reels and Stories, so here we will let you know the easiest way to make Instagram Reels and Instagram Stories.</p><h3 id="How-to-use-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#How-to-use-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="#How to use Instagram Reels?"></a>#How to use Instagram Reels?</h3><p>To make perfect and creative Instagram Reels, follow the below-mentioned process:</p><p>1. Swipe left or click on the camera button on the top left corner to open the camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/launch-instagram-app1.jpg"                      alt="launch instagram app"                ></p><p>2. At the bottom of the screen, tap on REELS to make a Reel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/find-reels-option2.jpg"                      alt="find reels option"                ></p><p>3. You will now have tools for editing your Reel on the left of your screen.</p><p>4. The four tools you can use are Audio, AR effects, Timer and Countdown, Align, and Speed. The <strong>Audio</strong> tool allows you to add any audio from the Instagram music library to your Reel. You can also use original audios, which will then be attributed to you, and your viewers can use that audio in their own Reels by selecting “Use Audio.” You can also choose different <strong>AR effects</strong> to enhance your Reels. The AR effects may be created by Instagram or its users. <strong>Timer and Countdown</strong> can be used to set a time limit for a single clip and set a countdown so that you can settle in before it starts recording. The <strong>Align</strong> feature smoothens the process of transitioning from one clip to another. Last but not least, you can also set the <strong>Speed</strong> of your Reel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-tab.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Reels Tab"                ></p><p>5. Use these tools to make a Reel as per your choice. Click on Next or Done.</p><p>6. You can add your caption and choose a cover for your Reel from the video or gallery on the Share page. You also have the option to Share to Feed. You can also save it as a draft if you don’t wish to upload it immediately. Otherwise, just click on “Share” to share it on the Explore page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-reels-on-instagram.jpg"                      alt="share reels on instagram"                ></p><h3 id="How-to-use-Instagram-Stories"><a href="#How-to-use-Instagram-Stories" class="headerlink" title="# How to use Instagram Stories?"></a># How to use Instagram Stories?</h3><p>Instagram Stories are a way for people to interact with their followers on a day-to-day basis. For this purpose, people often make stories of themselves or their surroundings. To do that, follow these steps.</p><p>1. Tap on the camera icon on the top left corner or swipe left to open the camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-insta-stories-1.jpg"                      alt="how to use instagram story"                ></p><p>2. You can then record a video or capture a photo. You can use various filters or add text and stickers to your Story, move and resize the text and stickers as per your need. You can also upload anything from your camera roll. To do that, simply swipe up after the camera opens.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-insta-stories-3.jpg"                      alt="posting a instagram story"                ></p><p>3. When you are done editing your Story, tap on “Your Story” to upload it. You also have the option to share it only with your “Close Friends” or DM it to someone by tapping on “Send to.”</p><p>4. You can view your own Story by tapping on your profile picture at the top of the Home page.</p><h2 id="Differences-between-Instagram-Reels-and-Stories"><a href="#Differences-between-Instagram-Reels-and-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Differences between Instagram Reels and Stories"></a>Differences between Instagram Reels and Stories</h2><p>Now let’s take a look at the difference between these two, Instagram Reels and Instagram Stories.</p><ul><li><strong>Time Availability:</strong> Instagram stories disappear after 24 hours unless they are saved in your highlights. While Instagram Reels stays in your Reels tab and feed.</li><li><strong>Length:</strong> For the Instagram stories, a video’s maximum length is 15 seconds, and for a picture, it is 7 seconds. For Instagram Reels, the maximum limit is 15 seconds too.</li><li><strong>Hashtags:</strong> Hashtags are used to gain more reach on everything you post. For the Instagram Stories, if you add a hashtag, the users must tap to see your Story. Since there are many stories, the chances of yours showing up are low. Plus, the Story disappears after 24 hours. For Instagram Reels, when a hashtag is searched, the Reels show up at the top due to the algorithm settings. This ensures maximum reach.</li><li><strong>Reach:</strong> Mostly, the people who view Instagram Stories are the followers of the account. In the case of Instagram Reels, people who do not follow can also view your Reels, increasing your reach.</li><li><strong>Saves:</strong> An Instagram Story of someone cannot be saved for you to view later. The Instagram Reels can be saved by the users.</li><li><strong>Explore Page:</strong> Instagram Stories rarely get featured on the explore page. On the other hand, Instagram Reels take the most space, ensuring they are watched the most.</li><li><strong>Editing tools:</strong> For the Stories, you can access filters, different layouts, and camera effects. While Instagram Reels gives access to more devices such as Audio editing, AR effects, Alignment of several clips and pictures, Timer, and Countdown, you can also control your actions’ speed.</li><li><strong>Sharing:</strong> Instagram Stories can be shared as a story or be sent to someone’s inbox, but they disappear 24 hours. Instagram Reels can be shared by almost anyone and do not disappear.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082532/7443" target="_top" id="2082532">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082532" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082532/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Is-My-Video-Suitable-of-Instagram-Reels-or-Stories"><a href="#Is-My-Video-Suitable-of-Instagram-Reels-or-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Is My Video Suitable of Instagram Reels or Stories?"></a>Is My Video Suitable of Instagram Reels or Stories?</h2><p>As discussed above in the section that focuses on using both the features, the type of content can be understood. Instagram Reels focuses more on content creation, while Instagram Stories focuses more on real-time events. A dance video is suitable for Instagram Reels, while a video made while traveling is suitable for an Instagram story. Sometimes an edited travel video can also be shared on Reels as content, while a rawer version is suitable for Instagram Stories.</p><p>So, in essence, anything that you want to reach to the world, anything that showcases your talents, is suitable for Instagram Reels. While anything you do as a recreational activity, whether it is dining out, reading a book, visiting a new place, or capturing a momentous occasion that is mostly personal, all these things is perfect and suitable for Instagram Stories.</p><h2 id="Make-Your-Instagram-Reels-Video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Make-Your-Instagram-Reels-Video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Make Your Instagram Reels Video with Filmora"></a>Make Your Instagram Reels Video with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>To increase your views on Instagram Reels, a well-edited video is a must-have.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Instagram-Music-Copyright-Rules"><a href="#Instagram-Music-Copyright-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Music Copyright Rules"></a>Instagram Music Copyright Rules</h2><p>Instagram is a popular social platform with over 2 billion monthly active users. It is a great place to share your photos and videos to build your social networking. And when you are connected daily to your new fans on Instagram, music adding-on is an integral part of it. Appropriate music can convey your feelings or mobilize the audience’s emotions.</p><p>However, you must understand its music copyright rules before sharing your tunes.</p><p>This article will give you a comprehensive guide to understanding Instagram’s rules about copyright music. We’ll also discuss a few tips for staying compliant and avoiding any potential copyright issues.</p><h2 id="How-Does-Instagram-Detect-Copyright-Music"><a href="#How-Does-Instagram-Detect-Copyright-Music" class="headerlink" title="How Does Instagram Detect Copyright Music?"></a>How Does Instagram Detect Copyright Music?</h2><p>Firstly, let’s look into the background of Instagram’s working mechanism for copyright music detection.</p><p>Instagram has an automated system that generally detects copyrighted content in user posts, live shows, or IGTV. Even though the procedure is automated, mistakes can still occur; however, this wouldn’t stop the platform from taking down posts or videos entirely from user profiles.</p><p>Instagram’s recently improved copyright infringement detection system now detects copyrighted music in content. The service sends a pop-up notification to the users, which gives them time to either stop using the track or change it in their posts.</p><p>If the system detects copyrighted content, here’s what happens to your Instagram account:</p><ul><li>Your post may be muted on Instagram.</li><li>Instagram notifies you to take the track down if you’re broadcasting a track during a Livestream.</li><li>Instagram may take down your post entirely.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"
