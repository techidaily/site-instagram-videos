Facebook, YouTube or Instagram TV all offer effective ways to advertise the products a company offers and ultimately boost its revenue streams. However, your posts on IGTV or any other social media platform may not be getting the kind of attention you were hoping for. If that’s the case, then you are at the right place because in this article we are going to show you how you can measure the performance of the videos you share on your IGTV channel.</p><h2 id="How-to-Measure-the-Performance-of-IGTV-Videos-1"><a href="#How-to-Measure-the-Performance-of-IGTV-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Measure the Performance of IGTV Videos?"></a>How to Measure the Performance of IGTV Videos?</h2><p> It has been less than a year since IGTV was launched, and it is already becoming obvious that this video sharing platform is here to stay. Such state of affairs presents a huge opportunity for anyone who wants to promote their products or services, as well as for video content creators who are looking for a new way to monetize their content.</p><p> Getting thousands of likes and comments on each and every post you share on IGTV is far from simple since you need to have the right type of content and a methodical approach to content promotion in order to be able to achieve this. IGTV also offers a few metrics that can help you gather the information you need to draw more attention to the videos you share on this platform.</p><h2 id="Which-Metrics-Are-The-Most-Important-For-IGTV-Video-Analysis"><a href="#Which-Metrics-Are-The-Most-Important-For-IGTV-Video-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Which Metrics Are The Most Important For IGTV Video Analysis?"></a>Which Metrics Are The Most Important For IGTV Video Analysis?</h2><p> In this regard, IGTV is fairly similar to any other social network, since the metrics you’re going to need to track are identical to those on YouTube or Facebook. Analyzing the statistics of each of your videos can help you discover the time of day that is the most suitable for posting new content on your channel or what type of videos are the most popular. Here are the metrics that the IGTV platform provides to all of its users.</p><p><strong>Views –</strong> After someone spends more than three seconds watching your IGTV video, that post will get a view. The number of views a video gets indicates the total number of people who interacted with it, even for a period of time that is as brief as a couple of seconds.</p><p><strong>Engagements –</strong> This metric shows you the combined number of likes and comments a video has at any given moment.</p><p><strong>Audience Retention –</strong> A rather important statistic that tells you the percentage of all viewers who watched a video from start to finish.</p><p><strong>Audience Retention Graph –</strong> A visual representation of the percentage of all views a video has at any moment. You can use this graph to see the exact point in the video where people stop watching it, which enables you to improve the content you share on your IGTV channel.</p><p><strong>Engagement Rate –</strong> This option is only available if you’re using an Instagram analytics app, such as <a class="link"   href="https://delmondo.co/instagram-analytics/" >Delmondo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that enables you to measure the engagement rate on each of your IGTV videos.</p><h2 id="How-and-Where-to-Check-the-Performance-of-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#How-and-Where-to-Check-the-Performance-of-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How and Where to Check the Performance of IGTV Videos?"></a>How and Where to Check the Performance of IGTV Videos?</h2><p> Accessing the IGTV analytics is a quick and simple process since you just have to open a video and tap on the <strong>three-dot icon</strong>, located next to <strong>Like, Comment and Share buttons</strong>. Once the menu appears on the screen, you just have to select the <strong>View Insights option</strong> and a new window will load on the screen showing you the number of <strong>Views, Likes and Comments</strong> that particular video has at the moment.</p><p> The <strong>Audience Retention Graph</strong> is located directly below these statistics, and you can use it at any moment to see <strong>the percentage of viewers</strong> who watched the entire video. These metrics can help you discover the type of content that can attract a large audience on IGTV. It is worth noting that these metrics are only available for IGTV videos, so if you’re also using Instagram and Instagram Stories you might want to consider installing an Instagram analytics app that enables you to conduct a more thorough analysis of the metrics the content you’re sharing is generating.</p><h2 id="How-to-Promote-IGTV-Videos-and-Get-More-Views"><a href="#How-to-Promote-IGTV-Videos-and-Get-More-Views" class="headerlink" title="How to Promote IGTV Videos and Get More Views?"></a>How to Promote IGTV Videos and Get More Views?</h2><p> Focusing on a single social network during an online marketing campaign isn’t necessarily a good choice, since sharing a video on multiple platforms can improve its visibility significantly. That’s why you should share your IGTV videos on Twitter, Facebook and all other popular online destinations that grant you access to a large audience. What’s more, you can also <strong>create a blog post that includes additional information about the topic</strong> a video is covering. If you scripted your IGTV video, then you can simply copy <strong>that script into a blog post and then just embed that IGTV video into the blog post</strong>. Alternatively, you can write a short description of the video that helps potential viewers get a better idea of what the video is about.</p><p> Each time you upload a new video to your IGTV channel you can use Instagram stories and Instagram live to promote your new post. The <strong>IGTV’s algorithm is relatively young and it still has a lot of room for improvement</strong>, which is why you have to use all means available to you that allow you to increase the number of views and likes your content is getting.</p><h2 id="Can-You-See-Who-Who-Watched-Your-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#Can-You-See-Who-Who-Watched-Your-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Can You See Who Who Watched Your IGTV Videos?"></a>Can You See Who Who Watched Your IGTV Videos?</h2><p> The shortest answer to this question is no. You can never know who watched your videos, just as other IGTV users can’t ever know that you watched a video they shared on their channel. As we already explained you can check how many people watched your video, but you can’t know who they are unless they also liked your video. Don’t trust the people who claim that they can help you find out who watched your videos, because they can’t.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Online marketing isn’t an exact science, but that doesn’t mean that you should disregard the statistics and the metrics provided by either IGTV or any other app designed to track the performance of your posts on social media. Do you think that audience retention or engagement rates can be essential for developing a viable online marketing strategy?

The app has revolutionized the way we digest content and the standards for creativity are always on the rise. With Instagram now offering a Bokeh effect feature, users can get this professional photography effect from their phones (or desktops).</p><p>This article will teach you what the Bokeh effect is, how to add this effect when taking photos and videos from your phone, bokeh effect apps and how to apply this feature on a desktop computer.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What is Bokeh Effect?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Apply Bokeh Effects in IG?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Best Bokeh Effect Apps for iOS and Android</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Add the Bokeh Effect for Instagram Videos</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Bokeh-Effect"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Bokeh-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Bokeh Effect?"></a>Part 1: What is Bokeh Effect?</h2><p>The word “Bokeh” or “boke” refers to the Japanese concept of “blur.” We’ve all seen images where one subject is in clear focus, and the rest of the image or video is blurred. This is the Bokeh effect in its most basic description. The reason this style of photography is so appealing is that it forces viewers to focus on a very specific part of the image, the part that is in focus.</p><p>A somewhat more complicated, but descriptive way to explain Bokeh is that it is not the actual blur of the background. The background blur is related to the depth of field in photography. Bokeh is the quality and feel of the reflected light points and surrounding “blur.” Complicated yet beautiful, and now accessible to people on mobile and desktop platforms.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Apply-the-Bokeh-Effect-to-Blur-the-Background-of-Instagram-Stories"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Apply-the-Bokeh-Effect-to-Blur-the-Background-of-Instagram-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Apply the Bokeh Effect to Blur the Background of Instagram Stories"></a>Part 2: How to Apply the Bokeh Effect to Blur the Background of Instagram Stories</h2><p>Adding the Bokeh Effect to your Instagram Story is easy, although not all mobile devices have this feature available. Worry not, there are a variety of apps you can download that can get you this effect, and you can upload your final image from the camera roll.</p><p><em>Steps for Adding the Bokeh Effect from the Instagram App</em></p><ol><li>Open Instagram and create a new story (click the + in the top left-hand corner of your home page or profile, or swipe right on the home page to access your Instagram camera).</li><li>At the bottom of your screen, you will find <strong>Focus</strong>. If you do not see this function skip to the instructions on how to access this effect using alternative methods.</li><li>Once <strong>Focus</strong> has been selected, you can take a photo or video that will feature the Bokeh effect. It is best achieved by photographing a person or a single object.</li><li>You can still edit the image as desired using Instagram’s filter options after taking the image with the focus effect.</li><li>Lastly, add to the story and you’re done!</li></ol><p>Again, <em>not all mobile devices are able to perform this function.</em> I’ve compiled a list of third-party applications you can download to generate the same effect.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Best-Bokeh-Effect-Apps-for-iOS-and-Android"><a href="#Part-3-Best-Bokeh-Effect-Apps-for-iOS-and-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Best Bokeh Effect Apps for iOS and Android"></a>Part 3: Best Bokeh Effect Apps for iOS and Android</h2><p>If you fall into the category of individuals whose Instagram does not include the Focus feature, there are a handful of apps you can use to create the Bokeh effect.

Or, go to the <strong>Reels</strong> tab and click on the <strong>camera</strong> <strong>icon</strong> in the top right corner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-tab.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Reels Tab"                ></p><p>2.Now, you edit the settings before you record or upload footage.</p><ul><li><strong>Audio</strong>- Choose a huge music library.

Instagram reels can be browsed from the Explore tab. And similarly, TikTok videos can be browsed from the For You tab. One major similarity between these two is the editing feature. There are various tools in both TikTok and Instagram reels that enable users to make their videos unique and entertaining.</p><p>Instagram reels are said to be inspired by TikTok but it has many differences that set it apart. Such as the video clip length for Instagram reels is reserved to 15 seconds, whereas TikTok videos can be up to 1 minute long. The biggest difference is that TikTok is an app dedicated to short videos and Instagram reels is a feature inside the parent Instagram app. TikTok allows the option of creating duets, but Instagram reels lack this option limiting user creativity. Even though both Instagram reels and TikTok have the option to add audio, Instagram reels don’t allow the addition of an original song. On the other hand, local music files can be easily uploaded for use on TikTok. Videos on TikTok do not disappear. However, Instagram reels uploaded as stories vanish after 24 hours and are not saved anywhere.</p><h3 id="Ready-to-try-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Ready-to-try-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Ready to try Instagram Reels?"></a>Ready to try Instagram Reels?</h3><p>Instagram reels have brought users a great opportunity of creating short yet influential videos right in the app. The ease and convenience of creating and editing videos is the reason behind its success</p><p>And, now you know all there is to know about Instagram reels. It is about time that you jump on this bandwagon and scale up your business or simply make your profile more appealing. Surprise your friends and family by creating highly engaging videos that are fun to watch. Captivate the audience with compelling content.

If you’ve been scrolling through your feed then this bar may have disappeared, in which case you’ll need to tap the camera button at the top left to bring it back again.</p><p>Now you should be in your story menu, which will let you choose one of three available options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/go-live-on-insta.jpg"                                     ></p><ul><li><strong>Live:</strong> This is Instagram live streaming, which disappears instantly once the broadcast is complete.</li><li><strong>Normal:</strong> Here you can add a photo or video which will be available for 24 hours</li><li><strong>Boomerang:</strong> This is for uploading a batch of photos which are stitched together to create a time-lapse type video</li></ul><p>For the purposes of Instagram live streaming, you’ll need to slide on over to the ‘Live’ option.</p><p>Before you begin broadcasting, however, check out your settings to ensure the right people can (or can’t) see the broadcast. You can also edit who is allowed to message you about this story, and block anyone you know to be a troll, for example. The ‘save shared photos’ setting does not work on your live streams, however, you can save your broadcast to your camera roll once you’ve finished the stream, thanks to a <a class="link"   href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/20/you-can-now-save-your-instagram-live-streams-to-your-camera-roll/" >feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> introduced by Instagram last year.</p><p>Now you’re all set. Check that your camera is pointing the right way, take a deep breath, and hit ‘Start Live Video’ once you’re sure you’re ready to start.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Manage-the-stream"><a href="#Step-2-Manage-the-stream" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Manage the stream"></a>Step 2: Manage the stream</h4><p>When thinking about how to go live on Instagram, it’s worth considering how you will manage your broadcast whilst in full flow. There are a few key settings built into Instagram which will help you to do this:</p><ul><li><strong>Viewer count:</strong> Up in the top right corner of your screen, you’ll see a number next to an eye. This tells you how many people are currently watching your stream. Keeping an eye on when people exit or join will give you some indication of how engaging they are finding your content.</li><li><strong>Comments:</strong> At the bottom, you’ll see a comment field, which will display comments made by your viewers. If you’re great at multi-tasking you can respond to comments as you go or ask people to message you their input, so you can reply to them after the stream. If you want to turn off commenting, tap the three dots in the bottom right corner.</li><li><strong>Likes:</strong> Viewers can express their love for your video in real-time, which you’ll see as a heart animation. Feel free to thank them and encourage additional likes where you can.</li><li><strong>Time broadcasting:</strong> Tap the little button that says ‘live’ to see how long your stream has been broadcasting.</li><li><strong>Block user:</strong> To see who’s watching, tap the little eye that is counting your viewers. If someone is becoming a nuisance, simply click the ‘x’ next to their name to remove them from your stream.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/go-live-on-insta-1.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Effective management of your stream is crucial, so ensure you are confident enough with what you want to cover in your broadcast that you can do this without interrupting your flow. Remember, there are no retakes with this type of content, so when planning how to start a live video on Instagram, make sure you dedicate enough time to the preparation to put you in a great position for an awesome video first time.</p><h3 id="Step-3-End-the-broadcast-and-wrap-it-up"><a href="#Step-3-End-the-broadcast-and-wrap-it-up" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: End the broadcast and wrap it up"></a>Step 3: End the broadcast and wrap it up</h3><p>To end your stream, simply hit the ‘end’ button in the top right of your screen. Instagram will return the limited analytics they hold for your stream, which is basically just the number of viewers. Unfortunately, Instagram Analytics doesn’t record data about your live streams, so it’s important to record this yourself for future reference. Either take a screenshot or note it down in some other way, so you can see how your different video topics return different results.</p><p>If you made any promises during your live stream, now is the time to keep them. Set aside a bit of time immediately after your video to follow up any direct messages, respond to any questions you might have had, and to send on any information as promised. Your followers will appreciate your swift response.</p><h2 id="How-to-make-good-use-of-Instagram-live-video-for-business"><a href="#How-to-make-good-use-of-Instagram-live-video-for-business" class="headerlink" title="How to make good use of Instagram live video for business"></a>How to make good use of Instagram live video for business</h2><p>It’s crucial to start figuring out how to go live on Instagram from a good, solid foundation. Unlike other video formats, live streaming offers no retakes, no edits, and no opportunity to undo your mistakes. For this reason, you need to have a good idea of what you’re going to be covering and how it’s going to work.</p><p>Here are some ideas, tips, and advice for making the most of your Instagram live streaming for your business, and how you can ensure you’re an insta-hit and not a flop-agram.</p><h3 id="Ideas-for-Instagram-live-streaming-videos"><a href="#Ideas-for-Instagram-live-streaming-videos" class="headerlink" title="Ideas for Instagram live streaming videos"></a>Ideas for Instagram live streaming videos</h3><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Create Instagram Business Account &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Before you can start thinking about how to start a live video on Instagram, you need to have a topic. Live streams really can be about anything, but some tried and tested formats work a little better than others. For example:</p><ul><li><strong>Q and A sessions:</strong> If you’ve got a product, service, or knowledge base to draw upon, invite interaction with your viewers for a session of questions and answers</li><li><strong>Instant feedback:</strong> Show you care and that you’re listening by inviting feedback on a new product or recent activity you’ve been involved with</li><li><strong>Behind the scenes:</strong> Viewers love to see how businesses operate, so why not take them on a tour of your warehouse or while you’re getting ready for a trade show?</li><li><strong>Tutorials and insight:</strong> Whatever your industry, you can be confident you know more than just about anyone else about what you do. Teach them how to use a product, give tips on getting the best from your service, or give them some insider tips that only you know</li><li><strong>Special guest features:</strong> You don’t have to have celebrity connections, but if you can rope in an influencer or brand to do an interview session with you, you’ll have double the traffic with your fans and theirs</li><li><strong>Comment on the comments:</strong> You’ll find a world of inspiration in your own direct messages and comments sections. Sure, much of it will be inane drivel, but just occasionally there is a</li><li><strong>Wonderful and wacky:</strong> Never underestimate the power of the unexpected. Sometimes just doing something a bit weird or unusual is enough to captivate a bigger audience than ever!</li></ul><p>Hopefully, these ideas for Instagram live streaming videos have given you some nuggets of inspiration to start your own amazing stream. What works for you will depend on your overall goal, whether you’re promoting a product, offering a service, or simply solidifying your position as an industry influencer. Brainstorm ideas before you begin, and keep a list of ideas on your desk, to add to as new motivation arises.</p><h3 id="Eleven-Live-video-tips"><a href="#Eleven-Live-video-tips" class="headerlink" title="Eleven Live video tips"></a>Eleven Live video tips</h3><p>You know you’re going to get noticed when you start a live broadcast on Instagram, so it’s important to get it the right the first time. Make the most of every Instagram live streaming opportunity you get with our 11 awesome live video tips:</p><ul><li><strong>Check who has tuned in:</strong> You can find out who’s watching your feed by tapping the eye icon in the corner of the screen. Viewers love a bit of interaction, so if you’ve got a regular viewer or a username you recognize, be sure to give them a shout out to acknowledge their visit.</li><li><strong>Make sure people know what you’re broadcasting about:</strong> Being clear about what your video is covering is a great way to get people hooked, and to keep them there. You can do this easily by pinning a comment that describes or offers a ‘title’ for your live feed.</li><li><strong>Keep reminding them why they came here:</strong> Your viewers chose to watch your Instagram live streaming session because there was a nugget they wanted a piece of. Whether it’s a product reveal, a key piece of info, or a tutorial on something, keep reminding them why they’re watching to maintain interest and stop them from leaving.</li><li><strong>Request direct messages:</strong> If you’ve got a popular live stream going, the number of comments can be overwhelming, to say the least, and can interfere with the flow of the video. Ask people with specific questions or comments to DM your account and take the time to reply to all of them once you’ve finished.</li><li><strong>Change the view:</strong> You can make your live broadcast more engaging and interesting by switching what the viewers see from time to time. Do this by reversing the view of your camera, maybe to show off a product or to see what is around you.</li><li><strong>Say no to trolls:</strong> The internet is full of them, and it can be highly frustrating to have to deal with someone trying to disrupt your broadcast. Rather than turning off all the comments, which defeats part of the object of live streaming, click the ‘X’ next to the user’s name to mute their comments instead.</li><li><strong>Save the videos you make:</strong> We learn as we go, particularly with new activities that we don’t have much experience of, so don’t forget to save your video so you can watch it back later. Don’t beat yourself up when you view your own video but do take note of what you love and what you hate so you can improve for the future.</li><li><strong>Announce and follow up each live broadcast:</strong> Announce your plan to do some Instagram live streaming with a post or story, so people know where to come and when. After, you can create a follow-up post or story to share with those who couldn’t make it along to the live broadcast, highlighting what happened and letting them know when you’re streaming next.</li><li><strong>Answer all those questions:</strong> Remember you asked your viewers to DM your account with their specific questions or comments? Well, now you need to keep your promise and reply to all those messages! Set aside sometime straight after your stream to do this, so that they aren’t kept waiting for a reply.</li><li><strong>Note your results:</strong> Keep a record of how many people watched your broadcast, and other useful metrics such as how many direct messages you got, or product inquiries were generated. This will help you evaluate which videos work the best for you, and to play your Instagram live streaming activities for the future.</li><li><strong>Be cool and calm:</strong> You’ve got this. There’s no need to panic if things wander off-topic, or if everything is not going quite as you planned; just take a deep breath and steer things back in the direction you wanted. Remember; people have tuned in to see you being you, so relax, be yourself, and enjoy the moment.</li></ul><p>When you’re thinking about how to go live on Instagram with your business, product, or personality, keep these top tips in mind for a more successful outcome.

Thus, you can solve the difficulty of fitting a single video as per aspect ratios of these platforms via auto-reframing tools.</p><p>So, choose the best and effective!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-adding-value-to-visuals-implementing-watermarks-in-instagram/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Adding Value to Visuals  Implementing Watermarks in Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-master-the-art-of-sharing-funny-gifs-instagrams-latest-trend-explained-in-4-steps/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Master the Art of Sharing Funny GIFs  Instagram's Latest Trend Explained in 4 Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-sifting-through-social-media-stars-targeting-your-specific-interests/"><u>[Updated] Sifting Through Social Media Stars  Targeting Your Specific Interests</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/steering-clear-of-echo-chambers-in-instagram-interactions/"><u>Steering Clear of Echo Chambers in Instagram Interactions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-free-toolkit-for-unrestricted-story-archiving/"><u>2024 Approved  FREE Toolkit for Unrestricted Story Archiving</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-postpresence-mastering-photo-and-video-sizing-on-instagram/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  PostPresence  Mastering Photo and Video Sizing on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-instagram-insights-ultimate-guide-to-understand-ig-data/"><u>[New] Instagram Insights  Ultimate Guide to Understand IG Data</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unlocking-the-process-for-final-deactivation-of-an-account-on-instagram/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Unlocking the Process for Final Deactivation of an Account on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-instagram-sounds-policy-explained/"><u>[New] Instagram Sounds Policy Explained</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-professional-framing-adding-bb-and-letterbox-overlays-to-fb-videos/"><u>[Updated] Professional Framing  Adding BB and Letterbox Overlays to FB Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/easy-guide-to-lava-storm-5g-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-by-drfone-android/"><u>Easy Guide to Lava Storm 5G FRP Bypass With Best Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-prime-approaches-to-chronicle-lol-clashes/"><u>[New] In 2024, Prime Approaches to Chronicle LOL Clashes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-the-art-of-photo-color-correction/"><u>In 2024, Mastering the Art of Photo Color Correction</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-best-15-subtitle-apps/"><u>New 2024 Approved Best 15 Subtitle Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/super-easy-ways-to-deal-with-samsung-galaxy-a14-5g-unresponsive-screen-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Super Easy Ways To Deal with Samsung Galaxy A14 5G Unresponsive Screen | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-master-your-media-adhering-to-twitters-video-requirements/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Master Your Media  Adhering to Twitter's Video Requirements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/best-7-multimedia-applications-for-macos-for-2024/"><u>Best 7 Multimedia Applications for MacOS for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/leveraging-regular-content-posts-for-enhanced-youtube-traffic-for-2024/"><u>Leveraging Regular Content Posts for Enhanced YouTube Traffic for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-customizing-teams-background-priorpost-meeting/"><u>[New] In 2024, Customizing Teams Background Prior/Post-Meeting</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

These will be the posts from people who you are not following but might interest you. Although many people are happy with this new feature because it kind of markets you so that other people can start following; however, people who repeatedly see suggested posts aren’t really happy about it.</p><p>The reason? These people aren’t interested in seeing random people’s posts on their feed. If you feel the same and want to know <strong>how to turn off suggested posts on Instagram,</strong> you have come to the right place.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What is Instagram Suggested?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How to Turn off Suggested Posts on Instagram?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Delete Suggested Users from Instagram?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Avoid Showing up in Other Users’ Suggestions for Your List?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: How Does Instagram Suggestions Work?</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Instagram-Suggested"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Instagram-Suggested" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Instagram Suggested?"></a>Part 1: What is Instagram Suggested?</h2><p>Instagram is working on its features and has recently rolled out the new feature called suggested posts. When Instagram suggests something on its own, it will be basically posts of random people who Instagram thinks you might be interested in checking out. These posts will appear when you reach the end of your feed.</p><p>Also, these posts will be based on what you prefer to see on Instagram, in general. If you are whether these will be the same as the ones that show up in explore, then no, they won’t be that. These posts will be related to the ones that you already follow or often browse through.</p><p>Suggested posts will let you scroll through Instagram a bit more and even give you a chance to follow the person you don’t follow. Along with suggested posts, there is another feature called suggested friends. You will see this right after you see the first or second posts.</p><p>The intent of these features is to know more like-minded people and follow them to see more of their posts.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Suggested-Posts-on-Instagram"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Turn-off-Suggested-Posts-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Turn off Suggested Posts on Instagram?"></a>Part 2: How to Turn off Suggested Posts on Instagram?</h2><p>So, if you are searching for answers to <strong>remove suggested posts on Instagram,</strong> here comes upsetting news, and that’s there is no direct way to stop seeing unwanted suggested posts right at the bottom of the feed. Instagram has also made it clear that there is no way one can close suggested posts. However, this certainly doesn’t mean that you can hide suggested posts at all.</p><p>And to do that, all you will have to do is make your account private. Once you do that, you will only be seeing posts on your feed of the people that you follow.</p><p>Here’s what you need to do:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your Instagram account and if you are not logged in, simply enter your credentials to log in. You can do this by visiting your Instagram mobile app or via the browser. Once your account is open, instead of going to your profile, stay on the home page, which shows you the latest posts of people you are following.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-suggestions-for-you.jpg"                      alt="suggestions for you on Ins"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the home page, where you can see posts of the people you follow. Now, scroll down towards the end and stop when you see the “you’re all caught up” message.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Right below that, you will see Suggested Posts, and the whole section will be filled with posts of people you don’t know.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, to stop seeing a recommended user’s post, you can click on the three dots. The dots will be towards the right of the user’s name.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Four options will be shown to you- report, not interested, copy URL, and finally, share. You need to click on the not interesting option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-suggestion-posts-options.jpg"                      alt="click on not interested on suggested posts"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> That post and user will be removed, and instead of that, you will see a message by Instagram asking for feedback. You can click on the option: I don’t want to see posts from this account, and Instagram won’t show you that user’s posts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-suggestion-posts-feedback.jpg"                      alt="choose your feedback option"                ></p><p>Now, you can apply the same steps for the rest of the posts as well. But do keep in mind that suggested posts will still appear. And you will have to apply this setting for each one so that you are shown fewer posts of unknown people.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Delete-Suggested-Users-from-Instagram"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Delete-Suggested-Users-from-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Delete Suggested Users from Instagram?"></a>Part 3: How to Delete Suggested Users from Instagram?</h2><p>If you don’t want to see suggested users on your Instagram feed, there is a way to remove unknown users actually. You can do it by using your web browser or Instagram mobile app. Whichever is comfortable to use. However, please note that these steps have to be followed for each suggested user. Now, please use that and then follow these steps.</p><h3 id="For-Instagram-app-users"><a href="#For-Instagram-app-users" class="headerlink" title="For Instagram app users"></a>For Instagram app users</h3><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, you need to open your Instagram account on your handset.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start looking at your Instagram feed. After one or two posts, you will see the Suggestions for You feature. Take a look at the screenshot to understand better.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, on top of every suggestion for you, you will see the x mark. That’s what you need to click on that. Ensure you are doing that for every suggestion that appears on your home feed. After clicking on the X, that account will not be suggested to you, and it will disappear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-instagram-suggestion-post.jpg"                      alt="click on x symbol to delete suggested users"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To delete multiple suggested users, just click on the see all option, and the list of suggested users will appear; now click on the X for each user you want to delete. However, you need to delete everyone one by one individually.</p><h3 id="For-web-browsers"><a href="#For-web-browsers" class="headerlink" title="For web browsers"></a>For web browsers</h3><p>The problem with web browsers is that you won’t be able to remove the suggested users like you can through your Instagram app on your Android or iOS devices. So, the only way out for you will be to open your Instagram mobile app and then do it from there by following the steps that we have mentioned for Instagram app users.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Avoid-Showing-up-in-Other-Users’-Suggestions-for-Your-List"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Avoid-Showing-up-in-Other-Users’-Suggestions-for-Your-List" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Avoid Showing up in Other Users’ Suggestions for Your List"></a>Part 4: How to Avoid Showing up in Other Users’ Suggestions for Your List</h2><p>Just like Instagram show you suggested users and posts, your account gets recommended to others as well. This is done so that your account can be followed by people who may be interested in your content. If you don’t want to get suggested by Instagram, then here’s what you need to do:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open a web browser and visit Instagram.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, look at the top right, where you can see your profile picture. Please click on that, and then click on the Settings option.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Scroll down towards the bottom, and you will find the similar account suggestions section. In this section, you will see a checkbox. You need to uncheck that if you don’t want your name to appear as a suggested user.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/uncheck-similar-account-suggestions.jpg"                      alt="uncheck the similar account suggestions box"                ></p><h2 id="Part-5-How-Does-Instagram-Suggestions-Work"><a href="#Part-5-How-Does-Instagram-Suggestions-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How Does Instagram Suggestions Work?"></a>Part 5: How Does Instagram Suggestions Work?</h2><p>Instagram takes note of everything that you do online. From analysing the posts, you follow, like, and comment on, Instagram tries to show you the best recommendations so that you can have a better user experience. The new feature that it has rolled out is the suggestions. The way suggestions work is quite simple.</p><p>The algorithm shows you suggestions based on your taste, the accounts you follow, and what you often browse through. This can be suggested users and suggested posts. Even if you keep your account private, you will still see the suggested posts, although suggested users will not appear. Instagram will keep track of what you like to see and explore, and based on that; the algorithm sends you suggestions that it thinks you will be interested in.</p><p>For example, let’s say you like to watch cats and dogs’ videos, so once you are done checking out the feed, towards the bottom, it will say “you’re all caught up,” and then it will start showing suggested posts of cats and dogs because you have checked similar content before.</p><p>So, based on that, it will start recommending posts and people that offer similar content. This encourages users to follow new people and stay updated with their latest posts. In addition to this, Instagram will also track the kind of hashtags you use, the posts that you have liked or commented on, and things like these.</p><p>So, even if you clear your search history, you will still end up seeing these posts. A user name will stop appearing if they go to their settings page and check out similar account suggestions. But most users don’t do that; hence, you will see their posts. Another thing to note is that these suggestions can be based on your Facebook friends as well because Facebook owns Instagram.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>So, now you know <strong>how to remove suggested posts on Instagram feed</strong> and how to go about it. Remember that Instagram suggested posts is a new feature, and there’s no way to delete this feature completely. You can certainly remove the suggested posts or suggested users, but you can’t completely remove suggested posts and users completely. However, this feature is quite handy because it lets you explore more content easily without going through the search tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-elevate-your-presence-mastering-ig-video-borders/"><u>[Updated] Elevate Your Presence  Mastering IG Video Borders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/expedite-your-social-media-presence-streamlined-video-upload-methods-for-instagram-desktop-for-2024/"><u>Expedite Your Social Media Presence  Streamlined Video Upload Methods for Instagram Desktop for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/techniques-to-decrease-film-duration-on-macos-for-insta/"><u>Techniques to Decrease Film Duration on macOS for Insta</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-enhancing-engagement-on-igtv-with-well-oriented-videos/"><u>[New] Enhancing Engagement on IGTV with Well-Oriented Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-instasoul-unleash-your-essence-through-100-dynamic-captions-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] InstaSoul  Unleash Your Essence Through 100 Dynamic Captions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-discovering-those-who-left-my-instagram-circle/"><u>2024 Approved  Discovering Those Who Left My Instagram Circle</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-key-to-viral-instagram-posts/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Key to Viral Instagram Posts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-harnessing-the-power-of-followers-for-impactful-advertising-campaigns-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Harnessing the Power of Followers for Impactful Advertising Campaigns for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-on-vivo-v27-pro-frp-bypass-by-drfone-android/"><u>Ultimate Guide on Vivo V27 Pro FRP Bypass</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-apple-iphone-12-to-other-iphone-14-pro-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-data-from-ios-transfer-data-from-ios/"><u>How To Transfer Data From Apple iPhone 12 To Other iPhone 14 Pro devices? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-stop-life360-from-tracking-you-on-samsung-galaxy-f54-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Stop Life360 from Tracking You On Samsung Galaxy F54 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/in-2024-battling-chromes-blank-screens-for-your-facebook-clips/"><u>In 2024, Battling Chrome's Blank Screens for Your Facebook Clips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-dissecting-the-prospects-of-active-presenter-for-techies/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Dissecting the Prospects of Active Presenter for Techies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-loopers-toolkit/"><u>[New] Looper's Toolkit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-leverage-netflixs-picture-in-picture-functionality/"><u>In 2024, Leverage Netflix's Picture-in-Picture Functionality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-master-class-in-meeting-transcripts-zooms-software-showdown/"><u>[New] Master Class in Meeting Transcripts  Zoom's Software Showdown</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/transform-your-brand-11-free-animated-logo-makers-and-essential-design-tips-for-2024/"><u>Transform Your Brand 11 Free Animated Logo Makers & Essential Design Tips for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>
