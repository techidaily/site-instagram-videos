The app has made it huge in the social media game, with roughly 1 billion official app users and 500 million daily active users of IG stories. By just creating an Instagram account, people may share videos directly from their cell phones. However, because Instagram allows for varied video lengths, figuring out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to post videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be difficult. There is a specific time limit for each video genre. All of those video forms, including Instagram feed and story videos, IG Live and IGTV, Instagram reels, and ad videos, will be covered in this article.</p><p>We’ll start by discussing what we mean by “Instagram video.” Instagram video encompasses the Instagram feed, Instagram Stories, Instagram Live, and Instagram advertisements, among other things. Instagram continues to expand at a rapid pace as more consumers and organizations migrate to mobile. Businesses are flocking to Instagram since it has shown to be successful. That’s not all, though as millions of businesses join Instagram, the chances of you running into competition increase. Businesses need to have a presence on Facebook because their customers expect it and search for them there, and the same is true of Instagram.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Tutorial for How to Record on GarageBand</a></p><h2 id="How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be"><a href="#How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be" class="headerlink" title="How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?"></a>How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</h2><p>Instagram feed videos, Instagram Story videos, IGTV videos, Instagram advertising, and Instagram Live have various length limitations. We’ve broken down Instagram video length details for each of them in this guide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-1.png"                      alt="instagram video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Story-Video"><a href="#Instagram-Story-Video" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Story Video"></a>Instagram Story Video</h4><p>Instagram Stories are full-screen, vertical photographs and videos that vanish after 24 hours. Rather than appearing in the news feed, they appear at the top of the Instagram app. To make your material stand out, they use interactive features like stickers, polls, and Instagram Story filters.</p><p>Each Instagram Story has a length of 15-second time limit. If you upload a video that is longer than 15 seconds, they will automatically cut it into 15-second segments. However, based on testing, it appears that you’ll only receive four 15-second parts. Thus, this is only suitable for recordings under one minute.</p><p>Furthermore, to use the new feature and make lengthier Instagram Stories, simply tap the Your Story symbol and then press and hold the record button in the bottom-right corner for as long as you want to record a moment - without worrying about the 15-second limit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-2.png"                      alt="instgarm story video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Reels"></a>Instagram Reels</h4><p>Instagram’s newest feature is Reels. It also allows you to share small video snippets (up to 15 seconds in length) with all Instagram users. Before publishing your Reel, you can dub audio, tweak footage, and add instant effects. The Reel video will then appear in your followers’ feeds.</p><p>Instagram Reels length is now limited to 60 seconds in duration. Previously, the maximum length was 30 seconds, however owing to competition from TikTok, Instagram decided to raise it. TikTok, one of the platform’s main competitors, recently increased the video length limit to three minutes.</p><p>To use this feature, go to Create a New Reel and then press the left-hand down button to see the menu. To construct a reel, tap “length” to choose between settings.</p><h4 id="IGTV-Video-On-Instagram"><a href="#IGTV-Video-On-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="IGTV Video On Instagram"></a>IGTV Video On Instagram</h4><p>Creators can upload high-quality, long-form, vertical videos to Instagram TV, also known as IGTV. Users may use IGTV to generate more engaging content for their audiences. Because social media is all about sharing interesting content, IGTV is worth looking into.</p><p>Instagram’s IGTV section allows users to upload and view longer videos. IGTV videos length is of 15 minutes long on the Instagram mobile app and up to an hour-long on the Instagram website. And because these films are posts, they won’t vanish after a day as Stories do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-3.png"                      alt="IGTV video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video"></a>IG Feed Video</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>Videos can only be 1 minute or 60 seconds long when posted to the Instagram feed. In addition, if you wish to submit a video to your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts utilizing the app’s built-in editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-4.png"                      alt="IG Feed video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-Ads"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-Ads" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video Ads"></a>IG Feed Video Ads</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>If you want to share a video on your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts using the app’s built-in editor. You can then post it immediately to your profile. To do so, go to your profile and click the ‘+’ icon. Choose the video you wish to share and then click ‘next.’ That concludes the discussion. You can now share the movie on your social media accounts with an interesting caption.</p><h4 id="IG-Story-Video-Ads"><a href="#IG-Story-Video-Ads" class="headerlink" title="IG Story Video Ads"></a>IG Story Video Ads</h4><p>Instagram Stories advertisements are an excellent method to reach out to new people while also showcasing your brand, company, and products to an already engaged audience. Instagram Stories already have excellent engagement rates, with one out of every five stories receiving a direct reply from viewers.</p><p>The maximum length of an Instagram Story video ad is two minutes. You can utilize different story cards if you want to show your ad on an Instagram story. Each card can display a 15-second video or a single 5-second picture ad. Only the first three cards of a complete ad will appear in the Instagram story stream. After that, after touching on the ad, the viewer must choose whether or not to see more.</p><p>Furthermore, Instagram Stories will show 15-second or shorter video advertising for the duration of the video. Video ads lasting more than 10 seconds will be broken into different Stories cards.</p><h2 id="How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram"><a href="#How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?"></a>How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</h2><p>You must be thinking about how to upload flawlessly every time with all of these time limits and video publication options. Here are some helpful hints:</p><ul><li>If you’re worried your IG Feed video is too long and don’t want to edit it, make a video carousel post by breaking it up into smaller chunks. By swiping the post, the viewer will be able to see everything.</li><li>If you felt pressed to stay inside the time limit and made a video that was far too short, you can add more footage, slow it down, or add a loop. Another option is to use a video editor to make an intro and an end screen.</li><li>If your Instagram story is too long, you can cut it down using any Instagram video editor. Record the video, then open it in your app to edit and trim it down before selecting the clips to upload the full story.</li><li>In addition, if your Instagram ad video is longer than 15 seconds, Instagram provides 10 cards, each with a 15-second video duration limit. This will allow you to show your complete advertisement without compressing it.</li><li>The four-hour limit seems insufficient if you wish to have a more extended live stream on Instagram. Then, as soon as you reach the time restriction, you can easily go live again and re-start the stream as many times as you wish.</li><li>To make videos that will receive hundreds of likes on Instagram, you’ll need video editing software that allows you to change the aspect ratio of the videos you wish to submit. Wondershare Filmora is a video editing program that supports a wide range of video file formats and allows you to crop and prepare your videos for web use.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2039292/17094" target="_top" id="2039292"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2039292"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC240" width="954" height="1020"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2039292/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> That’s all there is to know about the length of Instagram videos.

However, because Instagram allows for varied video lengths, figuring out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to post videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be difficult. There is a specific time limit for each video genre. All of those video forms, including Instagram feed and story videos, IG Live and IGTV, Instagram reels, and ad videos, will be covered in this article.</p><p>We’ll start by discussing what we mean by “Instagram video.” Instagram video encompasses the Instagram feed, Instagram Stories, Instagram Live, and Instagram advertisements, among other things. Instagram continues to expand at a rapid pace as more consumers and organizations migrate to mobile. Businesses are flocking to Instagram since it has shown to be successful. That’s not all, though as millions of businesses join Instagram, the chances of you running into competition increase. Businesses need to have a presence on Facebook because their customers expect it and search for them there, and the same is true of Instagram.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Tutorial for How to Record on GarageBand</a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698824&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/dex3pro-screenshot-homepage.png"                      border="0"                >PCDJ DEX 3 for Windows &amp; MAC is the total entertainment DJ software solution, offering audio, video, and karaoke mixing ability.

We’ve broken down Instagram video length details for each of them in this guide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-1.png"                      alt="instagram video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Story-Video-3"><a href="#Instagram-Story-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Story Video"></a>Instagram Story Video</h4><p>Instagram Stories are full-screen, vertical photographs and videos that vanish after 24 hours. Rather than appearing in the news feed, they appear at the top of the Instagram app. To make your material stand out, they use interactive features like stickers, polls, and Instagram Story filters.</p><p>Each Instagram Story has a length of 15-second time limit. If you upload a video that is longer than 15 seconds, they will automatically cut it into 15-second segments. However, based on testing, it appears that you’ll only receive four 15-second parts. Thus, this is only suitable for recordings under one minute.</p><p>Furthermore, to use the new feature and make lengthier Instagram Stories, simply tap the Your Story symbol and then press and hold the record button in the bottom-right corner for as long as you want to record a moment - without worrying about the 15-second limit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-2.png"                      alt="instgarm story video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Reels-3"><a href="#Instagram-Reels-3" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Reels"></a>Instagram Reels</h4><p>Instagram’s newest feature is Reels. It also allows you to share small video snippets (up to 15 seconds in length) with all Instagram users. Before publishing your Reel, you can dub audio, tweak footage, and add instant effects. The Reel video will then appear in your followers’ feeds.</p><p>Instagram Reels length is now limited to 60 seconds in duration. Previously, the maximum length was 30 seconds, however owing to competition from TikTok, Instagram decided to raise it. TikTok, one of the platform’s main competitors, recently increased the video length limit to three minutes.</p><p>To use this feature, go to Create a New Reel and then press the left-hand down button to see the menu. To construct a reel, tap “length” to choose between settings.</p><h4 id="IGTV-Video-On-Instagram-3"><a href="#IGTV-Video-On-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="IGTV Video On Instagram"></a>IGTV Video On Instagram</h4><p>Creators can upload high-quality, long-form, vertical videos to Instagram TV, also known as IGTV. Users may use IGTV to generate more engaging content for their audiences. Because social media is all about sharing interesting content, IGTV is worth looking into.</p><p>Instagram’s IGTV section allows users to upload and view longer videos. IGTV videos length is of 15 minutes long on the Instagram mobile app and up to an hour-long on the Instagram website. And because these films are posts, they won’t vanish after a day as Stories do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-3.png"                      alt="IGTV video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-3"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video"></a>IG Feed Video</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>Videos can only be 1 minute or 60 seconds long when posted to the Instagram feed. In addition, if you wish to submit a video to your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts utilizing the app’s built-in editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-4.png"                      alt="IG Feed video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-Ads-3"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-Ads-3" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video Ads"></a>IG Feed Video Ads</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>If you want to share a video on your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts using the app’s built-in editor. You can then post it immediately to your profile. To do so, go to your profile and click the ‘+’ icon. Choose the video you wish to share and then click ‘next.’ That concludes the discussion. You can now share the movie on your social media accounts with an interesting caption.</p><h4 id="IG-Story-Video-Ads-3"><a href="#IG-Story-Video-Ads-3" class="headerlink" title="IG Story Video Ads"></a>IG Story Video Ads</h4><p>Instagram Stories advertisements are an excellent method to reach out to new people while also showcasing your brand, company, and products to an already engaged audience. Instagram Stories already have excellent engagement rates, with one out of every five stories receiving a direct reply from viewers.</p><p>The maximum length of an Instagram Story video ad is two minutes. You can utilize different story cards if you want to show your ad on an Instagram story. Each card can display a 15-second video or a single 5-second picture ad. Only the first three cards of a complete ad will appear in the Instagram story stream. After that, after touching on the ad, the viewer must choose whether or not to see more.</p><p>Furthermore, Instagram Stories will show 15-second or shorter video advertising for the duration of the video. Video ads lasting more than 10 seconds will be broken into different Stories cards.</p><h2 id="How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram-3"><a href="#How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?"></a>How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</h2><p>You must be thinking about how to upload flawlessly every time with all of these time limits and video publication options. Here are some helpful hints:</p><ul><li>If you’re worried your IG Feed video is too long and don’t want to edit it, make a video carousel post by breaking it up into smaller chunks. By swiping the post, the viewer will be able to see everything.</li><li>If you felt pressed to stay inside the time limit and made a video that was far too short, you can add more footage, slow it down, or add a loop. Another option is to use a video editor to make an intro and an end screen.</li><li>If your Instagram story is too long, you can cut it down using any Instagram video editor. Record the video, then open it in your app to edit and trim it down before selecting the clips to upload the full story.</li><li>In addition, if your Instagram ad video is longer than 15 seconds, Instagram provides 10 cards, each with a 15-second video duration limit. This will allow you to show your complete advertisement without compressing it.</li><li>The four-hour limit seems insufficient if you wish to have a more extended live stream on Instagram. Then, as soon as you reach the time restriction, you can easily go live again and re-start the stream as many times as you wish.</li><li>To make videos that will receive hundreds of likes on Instagram, you’ll need video editing software that allows you to change the aspect ratio of the videos you wish to submit. Wondershare Filmora is a video editing program that supports a wide range of video file formats and allows you to crop and prepare your videos for web use.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> That’s all there is to know about the length of Instagram videos.

As most of you already know, these videos must be recorded with the Instagram app, and for that reason, you can’t really use any of the video or sound editing apps you would normally use to add music to the videos you post on this photo and video sharing platform.</p><p>Using apps like Spotify to play music while recording your Instagram stories is currently the only way to add music to an Instagram story video. You should launch the Spotify app or any other app you choose, and then launch the Instagram app. If you would like to use a particular part of a song, simply pause the song at that section.</p><p>In order to start recording an Instagram story, you’ll need to tap on the camera icon that is located in the upper left corner of the app’s screen. Use the Control Center to switch to the app from which you want to play music from and hit play. Head back to the Instagram app and start recording your story while the music is playing. The 15-second video will be added to your Story after you click on the + icon.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152810&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/842ca578342915ccb8ae069595ba7233/products/copy_bootit-ss1_178x139.jpg"                      border="0"                >The BootIt Collection covers multi-booting, partitioning, and disk imaging on traditional PC’s using the standard BIOS and  newer PC’s using UEFI.   The collection includes BootIt Bare Metal (BIBM) for standard BIOS systems and BootIt UEFI (BIU) for UEFI system.<br></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Adding music to your Instagram stories and videos will make them more dynamic and fun to watch.

Hashtags enable you to discover new content, but they also provide you with an opportunity to make your posts on IGTV much easier to discover by the people who have never heard of your brand before. However, <strong>the hashtags you add to your IGTV videos</strong> have to be relevant, since there’s not much sense in using a popular hashtag that doesn’t have anything to do with the topic of your video. So, in this article, we are going to show you how to use hashtags to attract more followers and boost the number of views your videos are getting.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">The Benefits of Adding Hashtags to IGTV Videos</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Use Hashtags on IGTV Successfully</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">The Most Popular IGTV Hashtags You Can Use in 2021</a></p><h2 id="The-Benefits-of-Adding-Hashtags-to-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#The-Benefits-of-Adding-Hashtags-to-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="The Benefits of Adding Hashtags to IGTV Videos"></a>The Benefits of Adding Hashtags to IGTV Videos</h2><p>As the second decade of the 21st century draws to a close, it is becoming apparent that the video content and more specifically mobile video is going to become even more popular than it already is. The current numbers show that as much as 90% of consumers find videos helpful when choosing a product they would like to purchase. IGTV offers a huge opportunity for marketers as it enables them to reach their ideal customers directly and to offer them products or services through video content. What’s more, the vast majority of marketers think that videos increase sales, improve engagement rates and extend the reach of their marketing messages.</p><p>IGTV is quite useful especially if you already have a sizeable following on Instagram. Hashtags simply make all content you upload to your IGTV channel easier to find, which is why you shouldn’t skip adding them to all your videos if you want to reach new followers.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-Hashtags-on-IGTV-Successfully"><a href="#How-to-Use-Hashtags-on-IGTV-Successfully" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Hashtags on IGTV Successfully"></a>How to Use Hashtags on IGTV Successfully</h2><p>Before you choose the hashtags you would like to add to a video you intend to share on your IGTV channel, you must first do proper research in order to find which hashtags are the most popular for that type of video. There are four different hashtag categories you can choose from, and hashtags in each category serve a specific purpose.</p><ul><li><strong>Content IGTV hashtags</strong> indicate what your video is about.</li><li><strong>Industry hashtags</strong> are always related to the type of business you’re running.</li><li><strong>Branded tags</strong> on IGTV refer to your brand and they can contain the name of your company or anything else that relates directly to your brand.</li><li><strong>Targeted hashtags</strong> that are directed towards the audience you would like to reach.</li></ul><p>Each video you upload to your IGTV channel is slightly different, so you should choose the hashtags you add to an IGTV video carefully. Furthermore, you can’t add more than <strong>thirty hashtags</strong> to a video description which makes picking the right hashtags even more important.</p><p>Adding hashtags to the description of your IGTV video will make that video more visible to other users of the platform and it will enable the users of this platform to easily discover the content on your channel that they are most interested in. Moreover, IGTV has a ‘For You’ category where video suggestions are displayed based on the accounts and hashtags you follow, and if you want the platform to suggest your content to its users you should include hashtags in the description of each video you upload to your IGTV channel.</p><p>In addition, you can post a photo or a short version of your IGTV video on your Instagram account and use the same hashtags you used in the description of the video you posted on your IGTV channel. This is a great way to boost the number of views your IGTV videos are getting and to reach new people who can potentially become your followers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://godlikehost.sjv.io/c/5597632/1920054/21774" target="_top" id="1920054"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21774-1920054"                      border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1920054/21774"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="WonderShare-Filmora-A-Powerful-Tool-to-Edit-Your-IGTV-Video"><a href="#WonderShare-Filmora-A-Powerful-Tool-to-Edit-Your-IGTV-Video" class="headerlink" title="WonderShare Filmora - A Powerful Tool to Edit Your IGTV Video"></a>WonderShare Filmora - A Powerful Tool to Edit Your IGTV Video</h3><h4 id="Key-Features"><a href="#Key-Features" class="headerlink" title="Key Features"></a>Key Features</h4><ul><li>Keyframing: Make custom animations.</li><li>Motion Tracking: Automatic track moving object and add elements to it.</li><li>Audio Ducking: Fade your background music and make your dialogue clearer</li><li>Green Screen: Think beyond your imagination and be wherever you want.</li><li>Stocks of effects to help you create high-quality video.</li></ul><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082538/7443" target="_top" id="2082538"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082538"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082538/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698998&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/MacBook_Pro_lyrx-withsinger-tv.png"                      border="0"                >LYRX is an easy-to-use karaoke software with the professional features karaoke hosts need to perform with precision.

So, let’s take a look at hashtags that are currently among the most popular on IGTV.</p><p><strong>#igtv –</strong> Undoubtedly one of the most frequently used hashtags both in regular Instagram posts that promote IGTV videos and posts on IGTV. Variations of this hashtag such as #igtvchannel, #igtvcontent or #igtvcreator can also be used in all videos you add to your channel on this platform.</p><p><strong>#igtvfollow –</strong> Encourage the people who interact with your videos to start following you, by adding this hashtag to all your posts on IGTV. Alternatively, you can also use #seemyigtv or #followmyigtv hashtags to gain more followers.</p><p><strong>#igtdaily –</strong> Posting new content to your IGTV channel regularly is essential if you want to let people know that they expect a new post from you each and every day.</p><p><strong>#igtvart –</strong> In case you are producing content that is artistic in its nature, then perhaps this is one of the best hashtags you can use. Furthermore, if you are a musician you can rely on the <strong>#igtmusic</strong> hashtag to attract new followers.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Even though there is nothing complicated about running a channel on IGTV, you still need to dedicate some time to figuring out how your posts can reach a large audience. <strong>Adding hashtags to your IGTV videos</strong> is probably the easiest way to increase the number of views they are getting, but hashtags can also help you to grow the number of followers organically. That is the reason why all hashtags you add to your IGTV videos have to be carefully selected, since choosing a hashtag that is no way related to your video will not produce the results you are hoping for. Do you think that using hashtags can boost the amount of attention videos on IGTV are getting? Which hashtags do you commonly use to promote the content you share on your IGTV channel?

Today Instagram stories have become more popular than the OG Snapchat. Instagram stories are a great feature to share your journey with your followers. However, the stories are temporary and only last for 24 hours. You can view the stories of your followers in your feed but you can also check the stories of people you are not following on the discover feed. The person who posted the story can see who has seen the story through Instagram story viewer.</p><p>To find out more about IG story viewer and how it works, continue reading this article.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">1.

How Does Instagram Organize the Story Views?"></a>1. How Does Instagram Organize the Story Views?</h2><p>Over just a decade ago, Instagram has grown to become one of the most popular social media platforms with over 1 billion active users worldwide. Instagram is constantly evolving and introducing intriguing updates, intuitive design, and crazy monetization features. What started as a picture editing and sharing app, has now become a crazy online business tool. Celebrities, influencers, entrepreneurs and multi-billion corporations are all using Instagram to directly engage with their target audience and get new customers.</p><p>With millions of people using the app every day, Instagram has to constantly upgrade its algorithm to maintain transparency – so, cheats, no shortcuts, and no hacks! Instagram algorithms are based on engagement, hashtags, shout-outs, and other factors. However, engagement elements like comments, likes, saves, and views determine most content that will appear on the feed.</p><p>Instagram uses the same algorithm to organize the story feeds as well. Thus, how you engage and connect with your followers and audience will determine, how Instagram organizes the placement of your story and your story views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-instagram-story-viewer.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer"                ></p><h2 id="2-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-List"><a href="#2-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-List" class="headerlink" title="2. The Instagram Story Viewer List?"></a>2. The Instagram Story Viewer List?</h2><p>Instagram has two feeds, a vertical feed, and a horizontal feed. The vertical feed shows shared posts like an image, boomerang or reel. And, the vertical feed at the top of the page is the story feed. The story feed presents the micro user content. These are 15-second-long videos that appear for instant interaction with the followers. Instagram uses advanced algorithms to organize the feed and views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-instagram-story-viewer-list.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer-list"                ></p><p>Each story that people see generates views. These views are arranged in a story viewer list. Instagram story viewers list is the one that contains all your story views. To access this list:</p><ul><li>Open your Instagram app and tap on your profile picture at the top of your feed</li><li>If you have put up story there, look at the lower-left corner of the picture&#x2F;boomerang&#x2F;video</li><li>Here the people who viewed your stories will appear under the tag “Seen by #” (The “Seen by #” label will show how who and how many of among your followers have seen your story)</li><li>Tap on Seen by # to open the story viewers list</li></ul><h2 id="3-What’s-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-Order"><a href="#3-What’s-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-Order" class="headerlink" title="3. What’s The Instagram Story Viewer Order?"></a>3. What’s The Instagram Story Viewer Order?</h2><p>Previously Instagram story views were arranged in chronological order. However, in 2021 the story views are organized based on engagement. The new Instagram algorithm shows the accounts you engage with the most at the top of your story views list.</p><p>Similarly, the more engagement you have with the follower the more chances are of that follower to be at the top of the views list. These accounts are those that give you the most likes, comments, DMs, profile visits, saves etc. But this algorithm only works for those who get more than 50 views. If your story gets under 50 views then the list is sequential meaning that the one who watches your stories first will show up at the top of the list.</p><h2 id="4-How-Does-Instagram-Sorts-Instagram-Story-Viewers"><a href="#4-How-Does-Instagram-Sorts-Instagram-Story-Viewers" class="headerlink" title="4. How Does Instagram Sorts Instagram Story Viewers?"></a>4. How Does Instagram Sorts Instagram Story Viewers?</h2><p>Instagram sorts story views through an algorithm that is based on total profile visits, comments, likes and other interactive elements. Based on the data from these factors, Instagram ranks the reviewers of a story. As stated earlier the accounts users interact with the most will appear first in their story feed.</p><p>So, the key is to make your followers engage and interact with you. A lot of people have tried to crack the algorithm, but Instagram has kept it a secret so no one can manipulate it. This maintains transparency and tough competition among users. A useful tip is to use location sticker on story because viewers also view stories by location so using location hashtag in story can also prove to be effective.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-instagram-story-viewer-algorithm.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer-algorithm"                ></p><h2 id="5-Is-It-Anonymous-When-Viewing-One’s-Instagram-Story"><a href="#5-Is-It-Anonymous-When-Viewing-One’s-Instagram-Story" class="headerlink" title="5. Is It Anonymous When Viewing One’s Instagram Story?"></a>5. Is It Anonymous When Viewing One’s Instagram Story?</h2><p>In simple words no you cannot view your following’s Instagram stories anonymously from the Instagram app. Whichever account you use to view the story it will appear in in the story viewers list of the person who posted the story. A lot of people do use third-party apps to anonymously access Instagram stories. Other also create fake accounts to conceal their real identity.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4691139&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/SU-200-1.png"                      border="0"                >Software Update Pro - Check and update software installed on your computer. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-How-Can-I-Know-If-Someone-Viewed-My-Instagram-Stories"><a href="#6-How-Can-I-Know-If-Someone-Viewed-My-Instagram-Stories" class="headerlink" title="6. How Can I Know If Someone Viewed My Instagram Stories?"></a>6. How Can I Know If Someone Viewed My Instagram Stories?</h2><p>Instagram allows you to see who viewed your story when. To know if someone has viewed your Instagram story simply tap on your profile picture in the story feed and open the story you shared. Now follow these steps:</p><ul><li>At the bottom left corner of the screen, you will see “Seen by [number of views&#x2F;people who have seen the story]”</li><li>Tap on this “Seen by #” option to open your story viewers</li><li>This list contains all the people who have seen your story and tells you how many people have viewed your Instagram story</li></ul><p>A lot of people also use tools to view Instagram stories anonymously so for that you might need an Instagram story viewer app.</p><h3 id="Pay-Attention-to-The-Instagram-Stories-Algorithm-Change"><a href="#Pay-Attention-to-The-Instagram-Stories-Algorithm-Change" class="headerlink" title="Pay Attention to The Instagram Stories Algorithm Change"></a>Pay Attention to The Instagram Stories Algorithm Change</h3><p>When it comes to digital platforms algorithms are the tools that determine who should see which content. These algorithms are constantly upgraded to become more relevant and effective over time.

Putting keywords that best reflect what your business or your videos are about into your Instagram profile is important because by doing so your IGTV channel will be much easier to find. Even if you already have a big social media following, using keywords in your profile may get you a step closer to expanding the audience your IGTV videos can reach.</p><h4 id="2-Discover-the-Best-Time-to-Post-New-Videos-and-Share-New-Content-Frequently"><a href="#2-Discover-the-Best-Time-to-Post-New-Videos-and-Share-New-Content-Frequently" class="headerlink" title="2. Discover the Best Time to Post New Videos and Share New Content Frequently"></a>2. Discover the Best Time to Post New Videos and Share New Content Frequently</h4><p> Once again, knowing your audience and when they are the most likely to be using IGTV is essential for boosting the number of followers. The time zone in which your ideal viewer lives in or their age play an important role in choosing the time when you post new content to your IGTV channel. In general, the best time to post new videos on IGTV is from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. from Monday to Thursday, but you should try posting at different times of the day and see what produces the best results.</p><p> Posting new videos on your IGTV channel regularly is probably more important than sharing videos at an exact same time because your followers will gradually learn your posting habits. Upload new content at least once a week and do your best to stick to your posting schedule. Pick one or more days when you share videos and your followers will always know when they can expect your new content.</p><h4 id="3-Share-Your-IGTV-Videos-on-Facebook-and-Other-Social-Media"><a href="#3-Share-Your-IGTV-Videos-on-Facebook-and-Other-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="3. Share Your IGTV Videos on Facebook and Other Social Media"></a>3. Share Your IGTV Videos on Facebook and Other Social Media</h4><p> IGTV is a relatively new platform, which means that it still doesn’t have as many users as social networks such as Facebook or Twitter. That is the reason why you shouldn’t focus exclusively on IGTV in your social media marketing efforts because you can amass a large number of followers on all popular social media platforms. Sharing an IGTV video on Facebook, for example, can help you gain access to a larger audience since you will enable your current followers to share your videos with their friends on that platform. In addition, the people who like the videos you post on your IGTV channel can become your followers, even if they found out about your IGTV channel on some other social network.</p><p> <strong>Tips and Tricks</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >3 Ways to Share IGTV Videos on Facebook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="4-Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Content-Constantly"><a href="#4-Improve-the-Quality-of-the-Content-Constantly" class="headerlink" title="4. Improve the Quality of the Content Constantly"></a>4. Improve the Quality of the Content Constantly</h4><p> Both the topics of your IGTV videos and their quality matter, so if you are just starting out you should strive to improve the overall quality of the content you post on your channel through time. Purchasing a camera that is capable of recording HD or 4K videos and all other equipment that is necessary for the production of professional-looking videos can help you capture the videos in better quality. However, the stories your videos tell are equally important, which is why you need to choose the topics of your IGTV videos carefully. Writing a script for each new IGTV video you’re planning on shooting should make it easier for you to create captivating content that is going to attract new followers.</p><h4 id="5-Interact-and-Connect-With-IGTV-Users"><a href="#5-Interact-and-Connect-With-IGTV-Users" class="headerlink" title="5. Interact and Connect With IGTV Users"></a>5. Interact and Connect With IGTV Users</h4><p> Dedicate time to discovering the most influential IGTV users in your niche, and then make an effort to connect with them. A simple mention from someone who already has thousands of followers can do miracles for your IGTV account, which makes networking one of the most significant parts of the process of gathering new followers. Furthermore, you should reply to all the comments on your videos, and use every opportunity to interact with the followers you already have. By doing so, you will show your appreciation for the support your channel is already receiving, which may prompt some of your followers to recommend your IGTV account to their friends.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Each niche of IGTV videos is slightly different, and the methods you’re going to utilize to increase the number of followers you have on your channel depends on the type of content you are posting on this platform. The best time of the day to share new IGTV videos or which keywords you include in your profile depend on the audience you’re targeting, so you must do thorough research of the market before you start uploading videos to your IGTV channel.

Sit as far away from (or as near to) the camera as possible.

We expect businesses to experiment with using video chat to communicate with customers as Instagram develops. It can undoubtedly become a new approach to communicating with your followers to keep them involved and satisfied with your services.</p><p><strong>●</strong> Keep in mind that anyone who has sent you a direct message can video chat with you. You can easily block or mute someone who is video chatting with you to prevent them from doing so. Video conferencing is ideal for groups. You can video chat with your buddies for as long as you want if you have a good internet connection. Simply tap the red phone icon at the bottom of the screen to exit the video conversation.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Instagram is a free photo and video-sharing social networking platform.

We expect businesses to experiment with using video chat to communicate with customers as Instagram develops. It can undoubtedly become a new approach to communicating with your followers to keep them involved and satisfied with your services.</p><p><strong>●</strong> Keep in mind that anyone who has sent you a direct message can video chat with you. You can easily block or mute someone who is video chatting with you to prevent them from doing so. Video conferencing is ideal for groups. You can video chat with your buddies for as long as you want if you have a good internet connection.

The app has made it huge in the social media game, with roughly 1 billion official app users and 500 million daily active users of IG stories. By just creating an Instagram account, people may share videos directly from their cell phones. However, because Instagram allows for varied video lengths, figuring out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to post videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be difficult. There is a specific time limit for each video genre. All of those video forms, including Instagram feed and story videos, IG Live and IGTV, Instagram reels, and ad videos, will be covered in this article.</p><p>We’ll start by discussing what we mean by “Instagram video.” Instagram video encompasses the Instagram feed, Instagram Stories, Instagram Live, and Instagram advertisements, among other things. Instagram continues to expand at a rapid pace as more consumers and organizations migrate to mobile. Businesses are flocking to Instagram since it has shown to be successful. That’s not all, though as millions of businesses join Instagram, the chances of you running into competition increase. Businesses need to have a presence on Facebook because their customers expect it and search for them there, and the same is true of Instagram.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Tutorial for How to Record on GarageBand</a></p><h2 id="How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be"><a href="#How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be" class="headerlink" title="How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?"></a>How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</h2><p>Instagram feed videos, Instagram Story videos, IGTV videos, Instagram advertising, and Instagram Live have various length limitations. We’ve broken down Instagram video length details for each of them in this guide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-1.png"                      alt="instagram video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Story-Video"><a href="#Instagram-Story-Video" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Story Video"></a>Instagram Story Video</h4><p>Instagram Stories are full-screen, vertical photographs and videos that vanish after 24 hours. Rather than appearing in the news feed, they appear at the top of the Instagram app. To make your material stand out, they use interactive features like stickers, polls, and Instagram Story filters.</p><p>Each Instagram Story has a length of 15-second time limit. If you upload a video that is longer than 15 seconds, they will automatically cut it into 15-second segments. However, based on testing, it appears that you’ll only receive four 15-second parts. Thus, this is only suitable for recordings under one minute.</p><p>Furthermore, to use the new feature and make lengthier Instagram Stories, simply tap the Your Story symbol and then press and hold the record button in the bottom-right corner for as long as you want to record a moment - without worrying about the 15-second limit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-2.png"                      alt="instgarm story video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Reels"></a>Instagram Reels</h4><p>Instagram’s newest feature is Reels. It also allows you to share small video snippets (up to 15 seconds in length) with all Instagram users. Before publishing your Reel, you can dub audio, tweak footage, and add instant effects. The Reel video will then appear in your followers’ feeds.</p><p>Instagram Reels length is now limited to 60 seconds in duration. Previously, the maximum length was 30 seconds, however owing to competition from TikTok, Instagram decided to raise it. TikTok, one of the platform’s main competitors, recently increased the video length limit to three minutes.</p><p>To use this feature, go to Create a New Reel and then press the left-hand down button to see the menu. To construct a reel, tap “length” to choose between settings.</p><h4 id="IGTV-Video-On-Instagram"><a href="#IGTV-Video-On-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="IGTV Video On Instagram"></a>IGTV Video On Instagram</h4><p>Creators can upload high-quality, long-form, vertical videos to Instagram TV, also known as IGTV. Users may use IGTV to generate more engaging content for their audiences. Because social media is all about sharing interesting content, IGTV is worth looking into.</p><p>Instagram’s IGTV section allows users to upload and view longer videos.

The app has made it huge in the social media game, with roughly 1 billion official app users and 500 million daily active users of IG stories. By just creating an Instagram account, people may share videos directly from their cell phones. However, because Instagram allows for varied video lengths, figuring out <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to post videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> might be difficult. There is a specific time limit for each video genre. All of those video forms, including Instagram feed and story videos, IG Live and IGTV, Instagram reels, and ad videos, will be covered in this article.</p><p>We’ll start by discussing what we mean by “Instagram video.” Instagram video encompasses the Instagram feed, Instagram Stories, Instagram Live, and Instagram advertisements, among other things. Instagram continues to expand at a rapid pace as more consumers and organizations migrate to mobile. Businesses are flocking to Instagram since it has shown to be successful. That’s not all, though as millions of businesses join Instagram, the chances of you running into competition increase. Businesses need to have a presence on Facebook because their customers expect it and search for them there, and the same is true of Instagram.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Tutorial for How to Record on GarageBand</a></p><h2 id="How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be"><a href="#How-Long-Can-An-Instagram-Video-Be" class="headerlink" title="How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?"></a>How Long Can An Instagram Video Be?</h2><p>Instagram feed videos, Instagram Story videos, IGTV videos, Instagram advertising, and Instagram Live have various length limitations. We’ve broken down Instagram video length details for each of them in this guide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-1.png"                      alt="instagram video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Story-Video"><a href="#Instagram-Story-Video" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Story Video"></a>Instagram Story Video</h4><p>Instagram Stories are full-screen, vertical photographs and videos that vanish after 24 hours. Rather than appearing in the news feed, they appear at the top of the Instagram app. To make your material stand out, they use interactive features like stickers, polls, and Instagram Story filters.</p><p>Each Instagram Story has a length of 15-second time limit. If you upload a video that is longer than 15 seconds, they will automatically cut it into 15-second segments. However, based on testing, it appears that you’ll only receive four 15-second parts. Thus, this is only suitable for recordings under one minute.</p><p>Furthermore, to use the new feature and make lengthier Instagram Stories, simply tap the Your Story symbol and then press and hold the record button in the bottom-right corner for as long as you want to record a moment - without worrying about the 15-second limit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-2.png"                      alt="instgarm story video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Reels"></a>Instagram Reels</h4><p>Instagram’s newest feature is Reels. It also allows you to share small video snippets (up to 15 seconds in length) with all Instagram users. Before publishing your Reel, you can dub audio, tweak footage, and add instant effects. The Reel video will then appear in your followers’ feeds.</p><p>Instagram Reels length is now limited to 60 seconds in duration. Previously, the maximum length was 30 seconds, however owing to competition from TikTok, Instagram decided to raise it. TikTok, one of the platform’s main competitors, recently increased the video length limit to three minutes.</p><p>To use this feature, go to Create a New Reel and then press the left-hand down button to see the menu. To construct a reel, tap “length” to choose between settings.</p><h4 id="IGTV-Video-On-Instagram"><a href="#IGTV-Video-On-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="IGTV Video On Instagram"></a>IGTV Video On Instagram</h4><p>Creators can upload high-quality, long-form, vertical videos to Instagram TV, also known as IGTV. Users may use IGTV to generate more engaging content for their audiences. Because social media is all about sharing interesting content, IGTV is worth looking into.</p><p>Instagram’s IGTV section allows users to upload and view longer videos. IGTV videos length is of 15 minutes long on the Instagram mobile app and up to an hour-long on the Instagram website. And because these films are posts, they won’t vanish after a day as Stories do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-3.png"                      alt="IGTV video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video"></a>IG Feed Video</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>Videos can only be 1 minute or 60 seconds long when posted to the Instagram feed. In addition, if you wish to submit a video to your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts utilizing the app’s built-in editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-4.png"                      alt="IG Feed video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-Ads"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-Ads" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video Ads"></a>IG Feed Video Ads</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>If you want to share a video on your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts using the app’s built-in editor. You can then post it immediately to your profile. To do so, go to your profile and click the ‘+’ icon. Choose the video you wish to share and then click ‘next.’ That concludes the discussion. You can now share the movie on your social media accounts with an interesting caption.</p><h4 id="IG-Story-Video-Ads"><a href="#IG-Story-Video-Ads" class="headerlink" title="IG Story Video Ads"></a>IG Story Video Ads</h4><p>Instagram Stories advertisements are an excellent method to reach out to new people while also showcasing your brand, company, and products to an already engaged audience. Instagram Stories already have excellent engagement rates, with one out of every five stories receiving a direct reply from viewers.</p><p>The maximum length of an Instagram Story video ad is two minutes. You can utilize different story cards if you want to show your ad on an Instagram story. Each card can display a 15-second video or a single 5-second picture ad. Only the first three cards of a complete ad will appear in the Instagram story stream. After that, after touching on the ad, the viewer must choose whether or not to see more.</p><p>Furthermore, Instagram Stories will show 15-second or shorter video advertising for the duration of the video. Video ads lasting more than 10 seconds will be broken into different Stories cards.</p><h2 id="How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram"><a href="#How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?"></a>How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</h2><p>You must be thinking about how to upload flawlessly every time with all of these time limits and video publication options. Here are some helpful hints:</p><ul><li>If you’re worried your IG Feed video is too long and don’t want to edit it, make a video carousel post by breaking it up into smaller chunks. By swiping the post, the viewer will be able to see everything.</li><li>If you felt pressed to stay inside the time limit and made a video that was far too short, you can add more footage, slow it down, or add a loop. Another option is to use a video editor to make an intro and an end screen.</li><li>If your Instagram story is too long, you can cut it down using any Instagram video editor. Record the video, then open it in your app to edit and trim it down before selecting the clips to upload the full story.</li><li>In addition, if your Instagram ad video is longer than 15 seconds, Instagram provides 10 cards, each with a 15-second video duration limit. This will allow you to show your complete advertisement without compressing it.</li><li>The four-hour limit seems insufficient if you wish to have a more extended live stream on Instagram. Then, as soon as you reach the time restriction, you can easily go live again and re-start the stream as many times as you wish.</li><li>To make videos that will receive hundreds of likes on Instagram, you’ll need video editing software that allows you to change the aspect ratio of the videos you wish to submit. Wondershare Filmora is a video editing program that supports a wide range of video file formats and allows you to crop and prepare your videos for web use.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4599951&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="864" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jVnfr5HudQw" title="The Latest and Easiest Solution to Remove Kindle DRM on Windows (without Degrading)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>Epubor Ultimate for Win：Helps you read books anywhere, including the best eBook Converter + eBook DRM Removal functions.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> That’s all there is to know about the length of Instagram videos.

Thus, this is only suitable for recordings under one minute.</p><p>Furthermore, to use the new feature and make lengthier Instagram Stories, simply tap the Your Story symbol and then press and hold the record button in the bottom-right corner for as long as you want to record a moment - without worrying about the 15-second limit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-2.png"                      alt="instgarm story video length"                ></p><h4 id="Instagram-Reels-3"><a href="#Instagram-Reels-3" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Reels"></a>Instagram Reels</h4><p>Instagram’s newest feature is Reels. It also allows you to share small video snippets (up to 15 seconds in length) with all Instagram users. Before publishing your Reel, you can dub audio, tweak footage, and add instant effects. The Reel video will then appear in your followers’ feeds.</p><p>Instagram Reels length is now limited to 60 seconds in duration. Previously, the maximum length was 30 seconds, however owing to competition from TikTok, Instagram decided to raise it. TikTok, one of the platform’s main competitors, recently increased the video length limit to three minutes.</p><p>To use this feature, go to Create a New Reel and then press the left-hand down button to see the menu. To construct a reel, tap “length” to choose between settings.</p><h4 id="IGTV-Video-On-Instagram-3"><a href="#IGTV-Video-On-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="IGTV Video On Instagram"></a>IGTV Video On Instagram</h4><p>Creators can upload high-quality, long-form, vertical videos to Instagram TV, also known as IGTV. Users may use IGTV to generate more engaging content for their audiences. Because social media is all about sharing interesting content, IGTV is worth looking into.</p><p>Instagram’s IGTV section allows users to upload and view longer videos. IGTV videos length is of 15 minutes long on the Instagram mobile app and up to an hour-long on the Instagram website. And because these films are posts, they won’t vanish after a day as Stories do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-3.png"                      alt="IGTV video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-3"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video"></a>IG Feed Video</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>Videos can only be 1 minute or 60 seconds long when posted to the Instagram feed. In addition, if you wish to submit a video to your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts utilizing the app’s built-in editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-length-4.png"                      alt="IG Feed video length"                ></p><h4 id="IG-Feed-Video-Ads-3"><a href="#IG-Feed-Video-Ads-3" class="headerlink" title="IG Feed Video Ads"></a>IG Feed Video Ads</h4><p>The videos you submit to your main Instagram page, rather than your Stories, are referred to as Instagram feed videos. These appear on your followers’ Instagram feeds as well as on your main profile page.</p><p>If you want to share a video on your Instagram feed or profile, you must keep it under 60 seconds. If you have a longer than a minute video, you must use the app to select a 60-second frame and post it to your feed. You can trim the video and choose your favorite parts using the app’s built-in editor. You can then post it immediately to your profile. To do so, go to your profile and click the ‘+’ icon. Choose the video you wish to share and then click ‘next.’ That concludes the discussion. You can now share the movie on your social media accounts with an interesting caption.</p><h4 id="IG-Story-Video-Ads-3"><a href="#IG-Story-Video-Ads-3" class="headerlink" title="IG Story Video Ads"></a>IG Story Video Ads</h4><p>Instagram Stories advertisements are an excellent method to reach out to new people while also showcasing your brand, company, and products to an already engaged audience. Instagram Stories already have excellent engagement rates, with one out of every five stories receiving a direct reply from viewers.</p><p>The maximum length of an Instagram Story video ad is two minutes. You can utilize different story cards if you want to show your ad on an Instagram story. Each card can display a 15-second video or a single 5-second picture ad. Only the first three cards of a complete ad will appear in the Instagram story stream. After that, after touching on the ad, the viewer must choose whether or not to see more.</p><p>Furthermore, Instagram Stories will show 15-second or shorter video advertising for the duration of the video. Video ads lasting more than 10 seconds will be broken into different Stories cards.</p><h2 id="How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram-3"><a href="#How-Do-You-Adjust-The-Duration-Of-Your-Video-For-Instagram-3" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?"></a>How Do You Adjust The Duration Of Your Video For Instagram?</h2><p>You must be thinking about how to upload flawlessly every time with all of these time limits and video publication options. Here are some helpful hints:</p><ul><li>If you’re worried your IG Feed video is too long and don’t want to edit it, make a video carousel post by breaking it up into smaller chunks. By swiping the post, the viewer will be able to see everything.</li><li>If you felt pressed to stay inside the time limit and made a video that was far too short, you can add more footage, slow it down, or add a loop. Another option is to use a video editor to make an intro and an end screen.</li><li>If your Instagram story is too long, you can cut it down using any Instagram video editor. Record the video, then open it in your app to edit and trim it down before selecting the clips to upload the full story.</li><li>In addition, if your Instagram ad video is longer than 15 seconds, Instagram provides 10 cards, each with a 15-second video duration limit. This will allow you to show your complete advertisement without compressing it.</li><li>The four-hour limit seems insufficient if you wish to have a more extended live stream on Instagram. Then, as soon as you reach the time restriction, you can easily go live again and re-start the stream as many times as you wish.</li><li>To make videos that will receive hundreds of likes on Instagram, you’ll need video editing software that allows you to change the aspect ratio of the videos you wish to submit. Wondershare Filmora is a video editing program that supports a wide range of video file formats and allows you to crop and prepare your videos for web use.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ancheer.sjv.io/c/5597632/1657301/17326" target="_top" id="1657301"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17326-1657301"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="933"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657301/17326"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p><strong>●</strong> That’s all there is to know about the length of Instagram videos.

For business accounts, think of the Instagram Highlights as a specifically curated folder where your audience can find all the information they need in an organized manner. The better curated your Highlights, the more your audience can understand who you are and what you do or sell.</p><h3 id="1-Organize-and-Categorize-Your-Highlights-Strategically"><a href="#1-Organize-and-Categorize-Your-Highlights-Strategically" class="headerlink" title="1.

Organize and Categorize Your Highlights Strategically</h3><p>When curating Instagram Highlights for your business account it is imperative that the content is placed in categories that are organized by their purpose.</p><p>For example, if you create a Highlight meant to showcase your hours of operation, you would <em>not</em> include a story that features new products. When your audience is looking to gain more information about your business they want to find this information with ease.</p><p>Naming your Instagram Highlight must be done strategically so that users can find what they are looking for without any guesswork. Additionally, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >creating a cover image <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your highlight that coincides with the content will also better suit your business account. Instagram celebrates the visual learners in all of us, use that to your advantage.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ancheer.sjv.io/c/5597632/1657301/17326" target="_top" id="1657301"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17326-1657301"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="933"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657301/17326"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Keep-it-Concise"><a href="#2-Keep-it-Concise" class="headerlink" title="2. Keep it Concise"></a>2. Keep it Concise</h3><p>This feature allows you to upload up to 100 stories per Highlight. Wow! 100 stories!?</p><p>It seems great, that is until you remember how small of a window you have to capture a potential customer&#x2F;buyer. While some Highlight categories might call for more content, be sure to pick the most important, eye-catching and engaging stories to feature.</p><h3 id="3-Showcasing-Products-Services"><a href="#3-Showcasing-Products-Services" class="headerlink" title="3. Showcasing Products&#x2F;Services"></a>3. Showcasing Products&#x2F;Services</h3><p>One of the most successful ways you can utilize Instagram Highlights for your business account is to showcase the product and&#x2F;or service you are selling. A Highlight specific to these items is a lot quicker and easier for your audience to digest.</p><p>This feature is particularly beneficial for e-commerce businesses. You can implement the “swipe up” feature (if you have over 10,000 followers) to take your customers directly to your product pages. Products can also be tagged and take users to your Instagram Shop!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-story-highlight-show-product.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight show product"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940317&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Make-Company-Announcements"><a href="#4-Make-Company-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="4. Make Company Announcements"></a>4. Make Company Announcements</h3><p>Having a Highlight to feature company&#x2F;business announcements is a great way for your audience to stay up to date with what you have going on.</p><p>Maybe your business is hiring, opening a new storefront, or featuring star employees. This is the place to house that content. While it may seem difficult to make people care about updates and announcements to your business, you can curate content for this Highlight in a way that engages your audience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-highlight-company-announcement.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight company announcement"                ></p><h3 id="5-Promote-Events"><a href="#5-Promote-Events" class="headerlink" title="5. Promote Events"></a>5. Promote Events</h3><p>Using Instagram to promote your event is a great way to build awareness and gauge interest from your audience.</p><p>Because the story feature only operates for 24 hours, having a Highlight for an upcoming event allows people to view the information for as long as you make it viewable. Make sure to include stories that provide the date, time and location of your event. Don’t forget that you can utilize other Instagram functions such as the “poll” to help you gain an understanding of how many people will be coming to your event.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-highlight-promote-event.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight promote event"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Interact-with-your-Audience"><a href="#6-Interact-with-your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="6. Interact with your Audience"></a>6. Interact with your Audience</h3><p>Gain a better understanding of your customers by interacting with them in your stories. But don’t limit these interactions to 24 hours. By including an interactive Highlight on your business Instagram, you can learn all kinds of things about your customers.</p><p>Another key interaction tool that would help boost your business account is the question feature. This feature allows you to ask your audience questions and get their feedback in real time. Their responses will be sent directly to your Direct Message box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/interact-with-audience-instagram-highlight.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight interact with audience"                ></p><h3 id="7-Answer-Frequently-Asked-Questions-FAQ"><a href="#7-Answer-Frequently-Asked-Questions-FAQ" class="headerlink" title="7. Answer Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)"></a>7. Answer Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3><p>Instead of leaving things up to the imagination, or having your audience sort through pages to find the answer to their question, creating an FAQ Highlight on your account can help your audience better understand important details about your business.</p><p>Don’t hesitate to include basic information in your FAQ highlight. You’d be surprised how the easiest of details can be forgotten. Try including the question feature as one of your slides, so that users can submit questions they have that you can include in the Highlight moving forward.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-frequently-asked-question.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight  usage - show faq"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=194977&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.blumentals.net/scrfactory/images/screensaver-software.png"                      border="0"                >Screensaver Factory, Create stunning professional screensavers within minutes.

How-To Guides"></a>8. How-To Guides</h3><p>If your product requires assembly or tips for use, consider creating a Highlight that shows customers how to use or build your product. Showing your customers the proper way to use your product will help instill trust in your brand. This is especially important if the product you are selling is on the high-end spectrum. If potential buyers can see the outcome of the product once put together or used, they might be more inclined to purchase from you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1412049&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.winxdvd.com/affiliate/new-banner/pt-200x200.jpg"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="9-Showcase-Reviews-Testimonials"><a href="#9-Showcase-Reviews-Testimonials" class="headerlink" title="9.

There is great value in showing love and support for your product, so don’t hesitate to highlight this in a Highlight. While tip #2 stated the importance of being concise, this is one highlight we recommend you make as long as possible. The more positive testimonials and reviews you can promote, the more trustworthy your brand becomes.</p><h3 id="10-Share-Promotions-Deals"><a href="#10-Share-Promotions-Deals" class="headerlink" title="10. Share Promotions&#x2F;Deals"></a>10. Share Promotions&#x2F;Deals</h3><p>The final tip we’d like to share is using Instagram Highlights to share any promotions or deals you are offering.</p><p>Boosting sales on Instagram is a great way to attract new business and followers. Offering deals to new and existing customers prompts users to interact with your business and generate sales. Running a giveaway on your Instagram can also help build your following. To do so you must include conditions of the giveaway that requires users to follow you and interact with your content in order to be entered.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-highlight-share-promotion.jpg"                      alt="Instagram highlight  usage - share promotion"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4693127&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.videosoftdev.com/images/video_editor/screenshots/1.jpg"                      border="0"                ><br>VSDC Pro Video Editor is a light professional non-linear video editing suite for creating a movie of any complexity.
