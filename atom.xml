A supplementary app (Hyperlapse) for Instagram is specifically developed to allow users to accelerate Instagram video speed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hyperlapse-from-instagram.jpg"                      alt="hyperlapse from instagram"                ></p><p>You have the option of uploading a video from your iPhone or shooting a movie from inside the application. By default, your video is being played at a speed of 6X. This software, however, also has several drawbacks. For example, it can only assist you in increasing the pace of the videos. There are no editing features.</p><p>To know how to speed up a video for Instagram using Hyperlapse, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Hyperlapse on your iPhone, press the <strong>record</strong> button. Stop filming anytime you wish and keep your hands motionless.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You’ll see a speedometer now. The default speed is <strong>6X</strong>, but you may lower it to <strong>1X</strong> or boost it to <strong>12X</strong> if you choose. Move to the right to speed up the video.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Right after you’ve chosen your desired speed, click “OK.” If you want to share the video, you may do so on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Speed-up-Video-for-Instagram-on-Android-with-Filmora-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Speed-up-Video-for-Instagram-on-Android-with-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Speed up Video for Instagram on Android with Filmora?"></a>Part 2: How to Speed up Video for Instagram on Android with Filmora?</h2><p>On Android, you do not have access to the Hyperlapse application.

Fortunately for all of us, turning off notifications is a quick and simple process that can be completed in just a few clicks or taps. IGTV, Instagram’s latest mobile video platform is no exception, and if you decide to use it, you will occasionally stumble upon the content you don’t necessarily like and you will receive notifications about posts that really have nothing to do with your interests. In case you are looking for a way to get rid of IGTV suggestions, you’ve come to the right place because in this article we are going to show you how to hide videos you don’t want to see and how to switch off notifications.</p><h2 id="How-to-Turn-Off-IGTV-Notifications-on-Instagram"><a href="#How-to-Turn-Off-IGTV-Notifications-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How to Turn Off IGTV Notifications on Instagram"></a>How to Turn Off IGTV Notifications on Instagram</h2><p> Preventing IGTV notifications from bothering you while you are scrolling down your Instagram feed requires a minimum amount of effort. You just have to <strong>launch the Instagram app</strong> and then once the app opens, you should tap on <strong>the profile icon</strong> that is located in the bottom right corner. Upon arriving at your Instagram profile page, you will be able to see <strong>the hamburger icon</strong> in the top right corner. Tapping on the hamburger icon will grant you access to a menu that contains options such as <strong>Your Activity, Nametag or Saved</strong>. At the very bottom of this menu, you’ll spot the <strong>Settings icon</strong>, tap on it and after the <strong>Settings menu opens</strong> tap on the <strong>Notifications icon</strong>.</p><p> Select the <strong>Push Notifications option</strong>, and then scroll all the way down to the <strong>IGTV Video Updates section</strong> of the Push Notifications menu. Tap on the <strong>Off</strong> option, and you’re done, you’ll no longer receive notifications from IGTV. If at any point you change your mind and you decide that you want to receive notifications from IGTV you can return to the Push Notifications menu and select the <strong>From People I Follow</strong> or <strong>From Everyone</strong> option in the IGTV Video Update section of the Push Notifications menu.</p><h2 id="How-to-Hide-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#How-to-Hide-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How to Hide IGTV Videos?"></a>How to Hide IGTV Videos?</h2><p> At the moment this feature is only available on iPhones, while users who access IGTV from Android devices only have the option to report a video they find offensive or don’t like for any other reason. Once you open IGTV on your iPhone, you will be able to see the videos the platform suggests you should watch in <strong>the For You</strong> section. When you come across an IGTV video you no longer want to see, simply <strong>swipe down</strong>, and then <strong>tap on the three-dot icon</strong> that is located next to the Like, Comment and Share buttons.</p><p> A four-option menu will pop up on the screen, so you just have to <strong>tap on the Hide feature</strong>, and the platform will immediately remove the video you no longer want to see and the next video will start playing automatically.</p><p> The process of reporting an IGTV video from an Android device is nearly identical to the process of hiding a video on an iPhone. <strong>The only difference is</strong>, that you should select the <strong>Report option</strong> in the menu that pops up on the screen after you tap on the three dot icon. Using the Hide or Report options will enable IGTV to understand what type of content you like. That’s why you shouldn’t hesitate to use these options every time you see a video that covers a topic you’re not interested in or if you find its content offensive.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Optimizing IGTV in accordance with your interests and tastes doesn’t require much effort, as you can easily hide or report IGTV videos you don’t want to interact with. Moreover, you can get rid of IGTV notifications in case they interrupt you too often while you are browsing through your Instagram feed. Hopefully, this article will help make the experience of using IGTV more enjoyable for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-snapit-share-it-in-order-on-ig/"><u>In 2024, SnapIt, Share It in Order on IG</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-how-to-create-a-puzzle-feed-on-instagram-to-catch-attention/"><u>[New] In 2024, How to Create a Puzzle Feed on Instagram to Catch Attention</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-instagram-illumination-best-covered-ig-highlights-on-the-move-for-2024/"><u>[New] Instagram Illumination  Best-Covered IG Highlights on the Move for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-speed-up-video-on-instagram-mobileonlinedesktop-solutions/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, How to Speed Up Video on Instagram [Mobile/Online/Desktop Solutions]</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-banishing-bogus-buddies-from-instagram-social-structure/"><u>[New] Banishing Bogus Buddies From Instagram Social Structure</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-harmonic-hits-how-to-choose-the-perfect-song-for-ig-videos-for-2024/"><u>[New] Harmonic Hits  How to Choose the Perfect Song for IG Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-navigating-instagrams-live-broadcasting/"><u>[New] Navigating Instagram's Live Broadcasting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-spin-tiktok-magic-into-viral-instagram-reel-success/"><u>[New] Spin TikTok Magic Into Viral Instagram Reel Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-maximize-engagement-a-comprehensive-thumbnail-guidebook/"><u>[Updated] Maximize Engagement  A Comprehensive Thumbnail Guidebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/grasping-av1-starters-guidebook-for-2024/"><u>Grasping AV1  Starter's Guidebook for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-mirror-pc-screen-to-honor-x50iplus-phones-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Mirror PC Screen to Honor X50i+ Phones? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-to-use-pokemon-go-joystick-on-asus-rog-phone-7-ultimate-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to use Pokemon Go Joystick on Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-vintage-vs-modern-ranking-radio-sound-effects/"><u>Updated Vintage Vs.

Optimize Your Profile</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-02.jpg"                      alt="optimize your profile"                ></p><p>Ensure your Instagram profile is complete, including a catchy bio and profile photo. Fill out all of the necessary information in the “Contact” section so that users can easily reach out to you.</p><p><strong>#3. Know your audience</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-03.jpg"                      alt="know your audience"                ></p><p>There’s no point in creating a great Instagram account if you don’t know who your target audience is, what they like and dislike, what they are interested in, and what they aren’t interested in. You need to know as much about them as possible before you start growing your following because this will help you create content that appeals to them.</p><p><strong>#4. Post at the right time of day</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-04.jpg"                      alt="post at the right time of day"                ></p><p>As with most social media platforms, there are best times to post on Instagram. These vary depending on your audience, but the best time to post is between 9 am and 11 am EST (12 pm-2 pm GMT), 1 pm and 3 pm EST (4 pm-6 pm GMT) or between 6:30 pm and 8:30 pm EST (8:30 am – 10:30 am GMT).</p><p>There’s no exact science behind this; it’s just what has worked best in my experience as well as that of other Instagram marketing pros I’ve spoken with. The key is consistency—posting at different times makes you appear more human than if you were posting at exactly the same time every day—but not too much so that users get annoyed by how often they see new posts from you each day!</p><p><strong>#5. Use Hashtags to Reach a Wider Audience</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-05.jpg"                      alt="use hashtags to reach a wider audience"                ></p><p>Using relevant hashtags is a great way to make your content more visible and accessible to people looking for what you have to offer. Hashtags can help you connect with like-minded people and grow your online community.</p><p>So, start using hashtags today and see the difference it makes to your content strategy!</p><p><strong>#6. Engage with Other Users</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-06.jpg"                      alt="engage with other users"                ></p><p>You can’t just rely on others to come to you – go out and engage with them! Like and comment on other Instagrammers’ posts, follow them and participate in Instagram challenges or Instagram pods (groups of Instagrammers who support each other by liking and commenting on each other’s content).</p><p><strong>#7. Post-User-Generated Content</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-07.jpg"                      alt="post-user-generated content"                ></p><p>Encourage your followers to tag you in their Instagram posts featuring your product or brand. This not only gets more eyes on your profile but also builds trust and customer loyalty. And don’t forget to thank them for the shoutout!</p><p><strong>#8. Collaborate with Influencers</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-08.jpg"                      alt="collaborate with influencers"                ></p><p>Partnering with Instagram influencers in your industry can introduce you to their large following and vice versa. This can result in a significant boost in your Instagram followers.</p><p><strong>#9. Share Your Instagram Profile on Other Platforms</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-09.jpg"                      alt="share your instagram profile on other platforms"                ></p><p>Don’t forget to promote your Instagram on other social media platforms and your website or blog. Put the link in your bio and include it in any relevant posts or newsletters.</p><p><strong>#10. Take Advantage of Instagram Stories</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-10.jpg"                      alt="take advantage of instagram stories"                ></p><p>Instagram stories have become increasingly popular and offer a fun way for users to interact with your brand or business. Use them to showcase behind-the-scenes content, exclusive offers, or Q&amp;As with followers. And don’t forget to add relevant Instagram story hashtags or location tags to increase visibility.</p><p><strong>#11. Tag Brands in Your Posts</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/get-1k-followers-every-month-on-instagram-11.jpg"                      alt="tag brands in your post"                ></p><p>If using products from a specific brand, don’t forget to tag them in your Instagram posts.

You can pick any song that you like and add it as a background sound. However, when it comes to business accounts, there is a restriction.

The key is to search for a song with the words “Original Music.”</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Instagram Reels are beneficial for everyone.

Being a video content creator means that you should always have a fresh source of ideas for your next video, but at times we all simply run out of ideas. This is only natural, and if you find yourself facing a creative block you shouldn’t panic. Make yourself a cup of tea instead, make yourself comfortable and read on because in this article we are going to take you through ten awesome ideas you can use to create brilliant IGTV videos in 2024.</p><h2 id="10-Amazing-IGTV-Video-Ideas-You-Can-Try-in-2024"><a href="#10-Amazing-IGTV-Video-Ideas-You-Can-Try-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="10 Amazing IGTV Video Ideas You Can Try in 2024"></a>10 Amazing IGTV Video Ideas You Can Try in 2024</h2><p>Before we proceed any further, it is worth noting that IGTV only supports vertically oriented videos, and the content you create for your channel on this platform must meet its requirements. However, IGTV lets you share your videos on other social media, so your followers can always be up to date with your latest posts. Okay, let’s have a look at some ideas for IGTV videos you can try this year.</p><h4 id="1-Q-A-Videos-Answer-the-Questions-Your-Followers-Have-Asked"><a href="#1-Q-A-Videos-Answer-the-Questions-Your-Followers-Have-Asked" class="headerlink" title="1. Q &amp; A Videos: Answer the Questions Your Followers Have Asked"></a>1. Q &amp; A Videos: Answer the Questions Your Followers Have Asked</h4><p>Establishing a strong connection with the people who follow your IGTV channel should be one of your top priorities. Q&amp;A videos offer a perfect opportunity to strengthen that bond since you can let your followers ask you questions in the comments of the post you share on your Instagram profile or via Instagram stories and then create an IGTV video that answers the most interesting questions. This is a great way to show your knowledge in a certain area or to provide your followers with useful information about a given topic. The best part is that Q&amp;A videos are remarkably easy to create, so you won’t even need a pricey camera to record this type of video.</p><h4 id="2-Workout-Routine-Fitness-Videos-Never-Go-Out-of-Fashion"><a href="#2-Workout-Routine-Fitness-Videos-Never-Go-Out-of-Fashion" class="headerlink" title="2. Workout Routine: Fitness Videos Never Go Out of Fashion"></a>2. Workout Routine: Fitness Videos Never Go Out of Fashion</h4><p>Millions of people exercise at home, but quite a few of them still don’t have their routine. If you are a fitness or sports professional with tons of experience who knows a number of different workout routines you should consider creating IGTV videos that explain each exercise. Speeding up the video can be practical as it shortens its duration, but it can also help you create a more visually dynamic and entertaining video. In case some exercises in the video should be repeated more than once you can add text, so the viewers can know exactly how many times they should repeat each exercise during the workout.</p><h4 id="3-Reveal-a-Part-of-The-Atmosphere-on-the-Set-of-Your-New-IGTV-Video"><a href="#3-Reveal-a-Part-of-The-Atmosphere-on-the-Set-of-Your-New-IGTV-Video" class="headerlink" title="3. Reveal a Part of The Atmosphere on the Set of Your New IGTV Video"></a>3. Reveal a Part of The Atmosphere on the Set of Your New IGTV Video</h4><p>Recording a new video is always exciting, and the atmosphere on the set can at times be electrifying. If you manage to tap into that energy and share it with your followers, you’ll spark curiosity and build up the anticipation of your next post on IGTV. Furthermore, sharing a sneak peek from the set will make your followers feel involved in the process of making the video and it will provide them with the opportunity to share their opinions with you in the comments. Even a funny moment at the office can serve as a behind the scenes video that you can use if you temporarily run out of ideas.</p><h4 id="4-Tell-Your-Followers-What-Your-Customers-are-Saying-About-Your-Products"><a href="#4-Tell-Your-Followers-What-Your-Customers-are-Saying-About-Your-Products" class="headerlink" title="4. Tell Your Followers What Your Customers are Saying About Your Products"></a>4. Tell Your Followers What Your Customers are Saying About Your Products</h4><p>A satisfied customer is the best source of advertisement you can possibly get, and you shouldn’t hesitate to share the positive feedback with your followers on IGTV. These videos are remarkably easy to make since you can just combine a few shots of the person who left the feedback with the text. However, making the customer testimonial videos seem authentic is somewhat difficult, because you may have a tough time persuading your audience that the person in the video is not an actor or that the words you used in the video are actually theirs.</p><h4 id="5-Share-the-Ingredients-of-Your-Favorite-Recipes"><a href="#5-Share-the-Ingredients-of-Your-Favorite-Recipes" class="headerlink" title="5. Share the Ingredients of Your Favorite Recipes"></a>5. Share the Ingredients of Your Favorite Recipes</h4><p>Everyone loves food, but from time to time we all find ourselves completely out of ideas when it comes to our next meal. So, if you are already a successful food blogger, you can extend your presence on social media by creating IGTV videos that show the viewer how to prepare a certain dish. You can share your own recipes with the audience or you can show your followers how to prepare meals from different world cuisines. You can use the text to give detailed instructions about each step of the process to the viewers of the video or to share the entire list of ingredients with them.</p><h4 id="6-Start-a-New-Web-Series-on-IGTV"><a href="#6-Start-a-New-Web-Series-on-IGTV" class="headerlink" title="6. Start a New Web Series on IGTV"></a>6. Start a New Web Series on IGTV</h4><p>Some ideas are simply too complex to be covered in a single video, as their stories demand time to be properly told. In case you have such an idea you should consider producing a web series that can have as few as three or as many as ten episodes, depending on how much material you have. Keep in mind that producing a web series requires a significant amount of preparation because you are going to need a script for each episode, which is why you are going to have to develop the idea before you can actually start filming it.</p><h4 id="7-Create-Tutorials-and-How-to-Videos"><a href="#7-Create-Tutorials-and-How-to-Videos" class="headerlink" title="7. Create Tutorials and How to Videos"></a>7. Create Tutorials and How to Videos</h4><p>Sharing knowledge can be rewarding in so many different ways, and it can help you come up with authentic ideas for videos your followers on IGTV are going to enjoy watching. Producing makeup and hairdo tutorials or explaining how a product works is an excellent idea if you know enough about these topics and if you feel confident enough to show your followers how they can look ravishing or how they can use a camera, a software or any other product. Which type of tutorials and how to videos you can create depends largely on your area of expertise, so choose only the topics you know a lot about.</p><h4 id="8-Review-Videos-Review-a-Book-a-Restaurant-or-a-Movie"><a href="#8-Review-Videos-Review-a-Book-a-Restaurant-or-a-Movie" class="headerlink" title="8. Review Videos: Review a Book, a Restaurant or a Movie"></a>8. Review Videos: Review a Book, a Restaurant or a Movie</h4><p>Culture can serve as an endless source of ideas. Reviewing movies, books or restaurants can be a great way to introduce a certain culture to the people who follow you on IGTV. Japanese cuisine, cinema, and literature, for example, are so rich that you can dedicate your entire channel to them. The same is true for all great cultures of the world, but keep in mind that reviewing a book or movie may be a lot harder than it seems because it requires an impressive level of knowledge about art and culture in general.</p><h4 id="9-Unboxing-videos-Unbox-Gifts"><a href="#9-Unboxing-videos-Unbox-Gifts" class="headerlink" title="9. Unboxing videos: Unbox Gifts"></a>9. Unboxing videos: Unbox Gifts</h4><p>There is something strangely satisfying about watching others open gifts or things they got in the mail. This type of video is already quite popular among bloggers who also have an IGTV channel since they allow them to provide a link to their blog where they can review a particular product in more detail or provide pictures. In addition, posting this type of content on your IGTV channel can open up opportunities for sponsorships from brands in need of influential bloggers and Instagrammers who are willing to promote their products.</p><h4 id="10-What’s-on-my-Phone-videos-and-Capture-Screen-Recordings"><a href="#10-What’s-on-my-Phone-videos-and-Capture-Screen-Recordings" class="headerlink" title="10. What’s on my Phone videos and Capture Screen Recordings"></a>10. What’s on my Phone videos and Capture Screen Recordings</h4><p>New apps emerge at an astounding rate, while a lot of iPhone and Android users are still having trouble figuring out how to use simple social media apps like Facebook, Instagram or IGTV. That’s why recording the screen of your phone while using an app can be a great idea for an IGTV video. You can introduce your followers to new apps, or show them the advanced options of a popular app in your phones. You can record any activity on your phone you want, but you should only upload screen recordings to your IGTV channel that fit its general theme.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Despite the fact that all IGTV users can upload videos that last up to ten minutes to their channels, it is still better to keep the videos you share on your IGTV channel short and on point because the attention span of social media users can be quite short. Hopefully some of the ideas we shared with you in this article are going to help you find inspiration for your next IGTV video. Which idea did you like the most?

You have probably heard about companies getting Instagram influencers to market their products or services. Since influencers have tens to hundreds of thousands of followers, they offer companies a wide reach in these marketing campaigns. But how can you find Instagram influencers on a tight budget?</p><p> We attempt to explain the process of finding the right Instagram influencers for your niche marketing campaign.</p><h2 id="Five-Steps-to-Find-Instagram-Influencers-in-Your-Niche-for-Free"><a href="#Five-Steps-to-Find-Instagram-Influencers-in-Your-Niche-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="Five Steps to Find Instagram Influencers in Your Niche - for Free"></a>Five Steps to Find Instagram Influencers in Your Niche - for Free</h2><h3 id="Step-1-Establish-Your-Criteria"><a href="#Step-1-Establish-Your-Criteria" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Establish Your Criteria"></a>Step 1: Establish Your Criteria</h3><p> Before you go any further in the search for influencers, it is important to understand your marketing goals. Being able to find Instagram influencers is a lot easier when you have concrete goals.</p><p> Too many people think that if you find an Instagram influencer who has close to a million followers, you are all set. But it is not that simple. Yes, you want to find influencers who have many followers, as they will increase your brand exposure.</p><p> But what matters the most is finding the right influencer. It is why establishing a criteria for the influencer is important. This should be done before any search begins.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-influencer-criteria.JPG"                      alt="ins influencer criteria"                ></p><p> The <a class="link"   href="https://destinationthink.com/nine-criteria-selecting-right-people-next-influencer-campaign/" >type of criteria <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you could use in the search is whether they have an engaged audience, whether that audience is relevant to your company and the type of content they create.</p><p> Say an Instagram influencer has a million followers, but the number of likes and comments they get on a post is fairly unremarkable. It is a sign they have low engagement. In some cases, a person with around 100,000 followers and high engagement is better than someone with a million followers and low engagement.</p><p> It is crucial to assess the relevance of an influencer’s audience to your company. For instance, if you are selling computer gaming headsets, you must find an influencer whose audience shares an interest in gaming. If the influencer you find is a model who is followed for hair and makeup tips, using them would not be very useful to your marketing goals.</p><p> Finally, the influencer must create great content. You will be offering them a product or service in exchange for the branded content they will produce. And you are relying on that content being great.</p><h3 id="Step-2-Analyze-Your-Followers"><a href="#Step-2-Analyze-Your-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Analyze Your Followers"></a>Step 2: Analyze Your Followers</h3><p> It is surprising how many companies are able to find influencers just by looking through their own followers. Assess your Instagram account and see if you can find users who are regularly liking posts or commenting on them.</p><p> When you find users who have a high engagement on your profile, you can assess their profiles to see if any of them have high follower counts. If one or two of them have more than 10,000 followers, they could be useful to you for influencer marketing.</p><p> Even if you do not find anything through your own followers, you can always use related keyword hashtags to find influencers who are interested in the products or services that your company offers.</p><h3 id="Step-3-Use-an-Influencer-Network"><a href="#Step-3-Use-an-Influencer-Network" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Use an Influencer Network"></a>Step 3: Use an Influencer Network</h3><p> There are some very useful influencer networks that are available for free. While the free networks do not have the same analysis as paid varieties, they are still very useful in the search for Instagram influencers.</p><p> You can use an influencer network to find Instagram influencers who may have an interest in the niche that your company is targeting. All you need is a few promising leads that may be interested in talking and collaborating with your company.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-influencer-network.JPG"                      alt="ins influencer network"                ></p><h3 id="Step-4-Contact-Instagram-Influencers"><a href="#Step-4-Contact-Instagram-Influencers" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Contact Instagram Influencers"></a>Step 4: Contact Instagram Influencers</h3><p> Through steps two and three, you should have been able to get at least 10 to 15 names of Instagram influencers who are interested in your niche. If you got lucky, you may have found a couple who have a serious interest in your company, making the coming talks even easier.</p><p> Most influencers will have an email address that you can use to contact them for business enquiries. Use that address to send them a formal message. If they do not have any contact method, you can always send them a direct message on Instagram to get their attention.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/contact-instagram-influencers.JPG"                      alt="contact influencer"                ></p><p> When contacting an influencer, make sure you are being very open about the invitation. Talk about your company and brand, mention the product or service you are interested in an influencer marketing, and discuss the potential budget. If you want the influencer’s help for free, make sure you are mentioning this fact in the initial message.</p><p> Do not feel disheartened if a few influencers ignore your messages. There are so many companies contacting influencers for their assistance. It is normal that some message will be ignored or lost in the shuffle.</p><p> It is why you must cast your net far and wide. Contact as many relevant influencers as you can. The more people you contact, the greater your chance of getting into a collaboration with a few influencers for free.</p><h3 id="Step-5-Watch-Out-for-Competitors"><a href="#Step-5-Watch-Out-for-Competitors" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Watch Out for Competitors"></a>Step 5: Watch Out for Competitors</h3><p> A great way to find influencers who may be interested in promoting your products or services is by looking at what your competitors are doing.</p><p> Do not focus on the most popular company in the niche, as they may be able to offer influencers better compensation.</p><p> Look at companies in the niche who have a similar size and profile to your company. You can look at all the posts where your competitors have been tagged in. These posts will show you if there are popular Instagram influencers who are advertising the products or services that your competitors are offering.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> It can be hard to find Instagram influencers for a niche marketing campaign, especially if you are working on a limited budget. But the good news is that influencers also want to raise their profile by working with brands in their niche. It can be a mutually beneficial relationship. And if your company continues to grow through the marketing you are doing with Instagram influencers, you could even establish a long term relationship with that influencer.</p><p> If you are planning to edit Instagram video, you might want to try Filmora right now.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload
