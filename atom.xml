Though, if you are running out of ideas to post, then here are some poll questions for Instagram that you can consider.</p><ul><li><em>Asking about a location</em></li></ul><p>You can just post a picture of a place you have visited (like a famous monument or a city) and ask your audience if they have been to that place or not.</p><ul><li><em>Instagram Poll Questions on Food</em></li></ul><p>Content related to food always performs well on Instagram. Therefore, you can post a photo of a dish that you have made and ask your audience whether they like it or not. You can even ask whether they would like you to share its recipe.</p><ul><li><em>This or That</em></li></ul><p>You can find these poll questions for Instagram on almost every story these days. If you want, you can share a before and after look, pictures of two dresses, or anything else. Ask your audience which option they like the post.</p><ul><li><em>Can you relate?</em></li></ul><p>These are some of the most interesting Instagram poll questions that you can post. Simply post a picture of a situation that you are in and ask your audience whether they can relate to it. You would be surprised to know how many other people can relate to the same situation.</p><ul><li><em>Love or Hate</em></li></ul><p>This is similar to the “This or That” category, but the focus is on a single thing instead of two options. Just post a picture of a product and ask your audience whether they like it or not.</p><ul><li><em>Rating on a Scale</em></li></ul><p>Apart from a simple yes&#x2F;no poll, Instagram also lets us post a scale widget for a question. Your audience can just slide the scale (from zero to max) and let you know how much they like&#x2F;dislike anything.</p><ul><li><em>Do you agree?</em></li></ul><p>You can also see a lot of poll questions for Instagram in this pattern. Just post about something and ask your audience whether they agree to it or it. You can also ask them to DM you about their opinion if you want to engage with them.</p><h2 id="Explore-More-Ways-to-Use-Instagram-Polls"><a href="#Explore-More-Ways-to-Use-Instagram-Polls" class="headerlink" title="Explore More Ways to Use Instagram Polls"></a>Explore More Ways to Use Instagram Polls</h2><p>When it comes to the use of Instagram Polls, the sky is the limit. Since the feature lets us engage with our audience so easily, almost every brand is using it as a marketing tool these days. If you want, you can also implement some of these suggestions to make the most of Instagram Polls.</p><h4 id="1-Get-Instant-Feedback"><a href="#1-Get-Instant-Feedback" class="headerlink" title="1. Get Instant Feedback"></a>1. Get Instant Feedback</h4><p>If you know how to do a poll on Instagram efficiently, then you can instantly get the feedback of your audience. For instance, if your brand is working on a new line of products and you are not sure about something, then why not post it on Instagram. In this way, you can know the feedback of its end-users and would help in the product’s development as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-instant-ig-poll-feedback.jpg"                      alt="Instant Instagram Poll Feedback"                ></p><h4 id="2-Be-Creative"><a href="#2-Be-Creative" class="headerlink" title="2. Be Creative"></a>2. Be Creative</h4><p>You might already know there are so many ways to do Instagram polls these days. Though, if you want your content to stand out, then try to be a bit creative. Instead of posting a simple yes&#x2F;no poll, why not use emojis.</p><p>Let’s consider that you manage the Instagram profile of a beverage brand. Why not post a picture of a beach and ask your audience which beverage of yours they would enjoy the most. This would be quite an interesting post and will improve the engagement rate on your profile.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/creative-ig-poll.jpg"                      alt="Creative Instagram Poll"                ></p><h4 id="3-Redirect-your-audience"><a href="#3-Redirect-your-audience" class="headerlink" title="3. Redirect your audience"></a>3. Redirect your audience</h4><p>Product placement is one of the major things that you should consider doing in Instagram Polls. Though, apart from simply posting your products, you can ask your audience their opinion about it. Besides that, you can also include your website’s link or a DM option on the story. This will help you redirect your audience to your product page and can increase its sales as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/redirect-audience-ig-poll.jpg"                      alt="redirect audience Instagram Poll"                ></p><h4 id="4-Think-Beyond-Polls"><a href="#4-Think-Beyond-Polls" class="headerlink" title="4. Think Beyond Polls"></a>4. Think Beyond Polls</h4><p>While Instagram Polls are undoubtedly one of the best ways to engage with your audience, there are plenty of other features that you can try. You can consider posting a question as well to directly interact with your audience.</p><p>Not just that, you can also use a slider widget with a poll (or even without it). Instead of just selecting yes or no, this will let your audience slide their choice to a preferred value and will further spike their interest.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/think-beyond-poll.jpg"                      alt="Think Beyond Polls"                ></p><p>There you go!

Sometimes we need to accelerate the video to make it more engaging while also saving the viewer’s time. Because Instagram stories and posts have a limited length, we must speed up videos and present them as much as possible in a short amount of time.</p><p>However, most people don’t know <strong>How to Speed Up Video on Instagram</strong>, and if you’re one of them, don’t worry. This article covers an easy method to speed up the video on smartphones and computers and some online tools to assist you. Let’s get started.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How to Speed up Video for Instagram on iPhone with Hyperlapse?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Speed up Video for Instagram on Android with Filmora?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to Speed up Video for Instagram Online for Free?</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">How to Speed up Video for Instagram on Computer Desktop?</a></p><p>05 <a href="#part5">How to Upload Video from Desktop to Instagram</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Speed-up-Video-for-Instagram-on-iPhone-with-Hyperlapse"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Speed-up-Video-for-Instagram-on-iPhone-with-Hyperlapse" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Speed up Video for Instagram on iPhone with Hyperlapse?"></a>Part 1: How to Speed up Video for Instagram on iPhone with Hyperlapse?</h2><p>When speeding up Instagram videos, Hyperlapse is unquestionably the most acceptable option for iPhone users. A supplementary app (Hyperlapse) for Instagram is specifically developed to allow users to accelerate Instagram video speed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hyperlapse-from-instagram.jpg"                      alt="hyperlapse from instagram"                ></p><p>You have the option of uploading a video from your iPhone or shooting a movie from inside the application. By default, your video is being played at a speed of 6X. This software, however, also has several drawbacks. For example, it can only assist you in increasing the pace of the videos. There are no editing features.</p><p>To know how to speed up a video for Instagram using Hyperlapse, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Hyperlapse on your iPhone, press the <strong>record</strong> button. Stop filming anytime you wish and keep your hands motionless.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You’ll see a speedometer now. The default speed is <strong>6X</strong>, but you may lower it to <strong>1X</strong> or boost it to <strong>12X</strong> if you choose. Move to the right to speed up the video.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Right after you’ve chosen your desired speed, click “OK.” If you want to share the video, you may do so on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Speed-up-Video-for-Instagram-on-Android-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Speed-up-Video-for-Instagram-on-Android-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Speed up Video for Instagram on Android with Filmora?"></a>Part 2: How to Speed up Video for Instagram on Android with Filmora?</h2><p>On Android, you do not have access to the Hyperlapse application. Hence, you will need Filmora from the Google Play store. It’s one of the most well-regarded video editing tools available.</p><p>This application allows you to convert any video into a slow or fast motion video with no effort. The most attractive feature of this tool is that it allows you to speed up different segments from a single video simultaneously. However, you can only increase the video speed by a factor of two at the most.</p><p>To know how to speed up existing video for Instagram with Filmora, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Touch New Project to begin a new filming session at the bottom of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Choose the video you want to speed up and hit <strong>Import</strong>. After the editor is opened, you may begin editing. In the toolbar at the very bottom of the screen, choose <strong>Trim</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/trim-instagram-video-filmorago-android.jpg"                      alt="trim instagram video filmorago android"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You may need to slide to the left to view and click the <strong>Speed</strong> button in the toolbar.

Before IGTV was launched the maximum duration of a video on Instagram was limited to just one minute, which made this platform better suited for photos than videos. Today you can upload videos that last up to ten minutes regardless of the type of account you have, and if you own a verified account you can even share hour-long videos on your channel. In case you were trying to find out how you can shoot IGTV videos with your Smartphone or DSLR camera, you’re at the right place because in this article we are going to show you how to create videos that are going to impress your followers.</p><h2 id="How-to-Record-IGTV-Videos-With-a-Smartphone"><a href="#How-to-Record-IGTV-Videos-With-a-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="How to Record IGTV Videos With a Smartphone?"></a>How to Record IGTV Videos With a Smartphone?</h2><p>Before you can actually start uploading videos to IGTV, you first need to create your own channel. Once you’ve managed this step, you can then proceed to check if you have all the equipment you need to record a video. Obviously, you’re going to need a Smartphone that has a relatively <strong>powerful rear camera capable of capturing videos in HD or Ultra HD quality</strong>. You can only upload <strong>vertically oriented videos</strong> to IGTV, which is why it is slightly easier to record an IGTV video with a Smartphone than it is with a DSLR camera.</p><p>However, iPhones and Android devices are incredibly light and keeping them perfectly steady in your hand while recording is often difficult. That’s why you need a <strong>tripod for your Smartphone</strong> that will ensure that the footage is free of camera shakes. Both iOS and Android-based devices have their <strong>native camera app</strong> you can use to record IGTV videos, but if you would like to have <strong>professional camera features</strong> at your disposal during video recording sessions you should consider installing an app like <a class="link"   href="http://promovieapp.com/" >ProMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="http://cinemafv5.com/" >Cinema FV-5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your phone.</p><p><strong>Built-in microphones on Smartphones</strong> often pick up background noises or capture sound in low quality, so if you’re shooting your IGTV videos in less than perfect conditions, using an <strong>external microphone</strong> instead of the one on your phone might improve the quality of your video significantly. Optionally, you can skip recoding audio altogether and add music to your IGTV videos in the post-production.</p><p>The type of video you’re trying to create determines which pieces of equipment you’re going to need, since shooting a simple video of you walking down the street is quite different from recording an interview.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >&gt;&gt; Blue Screen VS Green Screen: All You Need to Know <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Shoot-IGTV-Videos-With-a-DSLR-Camera"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-IGTV-Videos-With-a-DSLR-Camera" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot IGTV Videos With a DSLR Camera?"></a>How to Shoot IGTV Videos With a DSLR Camera?</h2><p>Learning how to operate a DLSR camera takes time and practice, so in order to capture professional-looking videos, you need to use the camera as often as you can. Adjusting the exposure value or pulling focus manually may seem difficult when you first start producing videos, but learning how to do these things will make you a better cinematographer, and it will enable you to create brilliant content for your IGTV channel.</p><p>All you need to do when recording a video for IGTV is to <strong>turn your camera horizontally</strong>, in order to capture the video in the <strong>aspect ratio that matches the aspect ratio supported by the IGTV platform</strong>. Keep in mind that videos are commonly recorded in the landscape format and that you should only shoot vertical videos if you want to upload them to a platform like IGTV that only lets its users upload videos in the portrait format.</p><p>Unlike smartphones, DSLR cameras allow you to <strong>change the lens</strong>, which enables you to create a certain visual style by simply using a lens with a different focal length. In most cases, you’ll want to use a <strong>standard 18-55mm lens</strong> to record your IGTV videos because this type of lens can be used for a wide variety of different scenes. <strong>Ultra-wide lenses</strong> can create an entertaining effect by distorting the space depicted in the video, and they are often used to create video content for social media platforms.</p><p>Shooting videos on DSLR cameras also mean that you need access to a <strong>video editing software</strong>, because the raw footage often contains parts you don’t want to include in the final cut of your video. Professional video editing software products like <strong>Final Cut Pro or Premiere Pro</strong> may be too challenging for inexperienced video editors, and if you are still learning the ropes of the trade you should try using a less demanding video editing app for Mac and PC computers like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FUS.html" >PowerDirector <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The editing room is where your next IGTV video is going to get its final form, and you shouldn’t skip this step of the video production process just because it is time-consuming. If you want to impress your audience on IGTV you should work slowly and relentlessly on your footage until you are perfectly happy with the result.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>You don’t have to be a professional in order to record an IGTV video, but you still need to have at least basic knowledge about how cameras work and how you can use them to create vertical videos.

Instagram highlights provide a means for users to draw attention to and promote their brand. With these highlights, users can showcase and categorize their best content in a fancy and eye-catching way! Amazing right? Yes, it is and this is because Instagram highlights are front and center on your profile! This is a guide to Instagram highlights which explains what they are and how to use them.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Instagram-Highlight"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Instagram-Highlight" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Instagram Highlight?"></a>Part 1: What is Instagram Highlight?</h2><p>Instagram highlights, also known as Instagram story highlights, were introduced on the 5th December of 2017. An Instagram Highlight is displayed as a neat little circle on your profile. Unlike Instagram Stories that disappear after 24 hours, Instagram highlights stay on your profile permanently, until you choose to delete them. These highlights are tools designed by Instagram to enable its users to hold on to their favorite moments from their Instagram stories and share them in any way that allows them to express themselves.</p><p>Instagram highlights were included as a new feature of Instagram profiles through which users can express more about who they are through the various stories they have shared. They are designed to appear in the section on your profile which is located below your bio.</p><p>Story Highlights allows you to display all sides of your personality, and you can create highlights from anything you’ve already posted to your Story. From moments from your birthday dinner to moments of your vacation with friends. All these cherished memories, when shared on your Stories, can be saved and featured as Highlights on your Instagram profile.</p><p>An amazing feature of Instagram highlights is that you can group your stories into sections and create them as folder sections (i.e highlights) on your profile. Once you post a story, you can save it in a Highlight (which is like a folder) and that will automatically be featured on your profile permanently until you decide to delete it or archive it. With this tool, you can design your profile in a unique way that best expresses you.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Create-Instagram-Highlights-from-Stories-Archive"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Create-Instagram-Highlights-from-Stories-Archive" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Create Instagram Highlights from Stories Archive?"></a>Part 2: How to Create Instagram Highlights from Stories Archive?</h2><p>As mentioned above, Highlights are created through your Stories. You have two options for creating a Highlight. The first is that you either create a Highlight from a current Story or your Stories Archive.</p><p>Your Stories Archive is a feature that when enabled, ensures your Stories are automatically saved in your archive.

Let’s get started.</p><h4 id="1-What-are-Instagram-hashtags-and-how-do-they-work"><a href="#1-What-are-Instagram-hashtags-and-how-do-they-work" class="headerlink" title="1.  What are Instagram hashtags and how do they work?"></a>1.  What are Instagram hashtags and how do they work?</h4><p>Before we can start on how to hashtag on Instagram, it’s important that we’re all on the same page in terms of what they are and how they work.</p><p>In a nutshell, an Instagram hashtag is a bookmark; a way of categorizing content. It can be any word, phrase, number or even emoji which is prefixed by the hash symbol (#). Clicking on a hashtag on Instagram will bring up all the posts that have used that hashtag, so that you can discover new content you are interested in.</p><h4 id="2-Why-should-you-use-hashtags"><a href="#2-Why-should-you-use-hashtags" class="headerlink" title="2.  Why should you use hashtags?"></a>2.  Why should you use hashtags?</h4><p>Whether you’re a startup, new to Instagram or simply haven’t managed to acquire many followers, using hashtags on Instagram is a great way to grow your audience. By finding out how to hashtag on Instagram, your posts can be found by a much larger circle of users.</p><p>As a business, using hashtags on Instagram will help you be discovered by people who don’t already follow your page, helping you acquire new followers and boosting brand recognition. Not only that, but when you know how to use hashtags on Instagram, you can increase your reach on other channels too, because when a user shares your content to Twitter or Facebook, the hashtag is shared with it.</p><h4 id="3-What-types-of-hashtags-are-there"><a href="#3-What-types-of-hashtags-are-there" class="headerlink" title="3.  What types of hashtags are there?"></a>3.  What types of hashtags are there?</h4><p>When deciding how to use hashtags on Instagram, it’s important to recognize the various types of hashtags so that you can pick the right ones for you. The right hashtags will depend on your goals as a business, as well as the type of content you are sharing at that time. For example:</p><ul><li><strong>Product, service and general hashtags:</strong> These might be what you do as a business (e.g. #painter) or what product you sell (e.g. #furniture). They are good for brands who want to make their work or products better known but can be difficult to achieve engagement for as there tends to be high competition.</li><li>**Niche hashtags:**For more chance of being seen, niche hashtags reduce the competition by being more specific about your product or service. For example, #ladiesshoes rather than just #shoes will be found by more people specifically interested in shoes, while #ladiesheels will reach an even more interested audience.</li><li><strong>Interest hashtags:</strong> To reach enthusiasts in your niche, use interest related hashtags that describe your post. Research popular tags from the top posts section or see what specific groups are using to tag their posts. For instance, #shoeaholics or #heelsofInstagram will engage with those passionate about amazing footwear.</li><li><strong>Location hashtags:</strong> As you might have guessed, these tags are specifically the places where the content was show, for example #UK, #london or #hammersmith will find users who are interested in products, services or images from that location. You could also combine these with your service to narrow the audience even further, for instance #heelsinlondon or #londonfashionblogger.</li><li><strong>Branded hashtags:</strong> These types of hashtags are often used by businesses on Instagram to promote their brand or a particular ad campaign. You might promote the name of your business, e.g. #divashoes, or a slogan you are pushing, such as #comfortfit. However, be aware these don’t tend to get more followers on their own, because people won’t be searching for or adding branded hashtags to their posts unless they are compelled to do so. However, they can be great for engagement during a live event, for creating contests and to position your brand deeper in your audience’s mind, so use them where you can.</li></ul><p>Understanding these different types of hashtags will help you understand how to use hashtags on Instagram better, by lacing your post with a variety of suitable tags.</p><h4 id="4-How-to-add-a-hashtag-to-your-post"><a href="#4-How-to-add-a-hashtag-to-your-post" class="headerlink" title="4.  How to add a hashtag to your post"></a>4.  How to add a hashtag to your post</h4><p>If you’re not sure how to hashtag on Instagram, here’s a quick walkthrough. You can add tags as either captions to your post or in the comments area. As long as your account is public, the hashtag will ensure your post is discoverable via the corresponding hashtag page. Here’s how it works:</p><ul><li>Upload a photo or video to your Instagram account</li><li>Pick your filters and edit as required</li><li>Type the hash (#) symbol in the caption field followed by the text you want to be indexed for</li><li>Tap OK</li><li>Then share</li></ul><p>If you prefer to add your hashtag to the comments section, just find the post and type in your hashtag in the comments section. This is particularly good if you plan to use a lot of hashtags and don’t want to make your post look too messy.</p><p>Letters, numbers and emojis work as hashtags, but special characters and spaces do not. Don’t add in any symbols like * or %, and type words altogether without any spaces. You cannot add hashtags to other people’s posts, only your own, and can use up to 30 tags on any single post.</p><h4 id="5-How-to-find-the-best-hashtags-for-your-brand"><a href="#5-How-to-find-the-best-hashtags-for-your-brand" class="headerlink" title="5.  How to find the best hashtags for your brand"></a>5.  How to find the best hashtags for your brand</h4><p>If you’re not sure how to find the best hashtags for Instagram, there are a few options open to you:</p><ul><li><strong>Search:</strong> Just doing a simple search can throw up some interesting hashtags and useful data for your post. Click in the search bar and begin your query with a #. Instagram will present you with a list of suggestions as you start to type, as well as how many posts have been tagged with that particular hashtag. If you don’t know where to start, think about what your business does, provides or specializes in as a good launchpad. If you already have a list of keywords you use for SEO or PPC, this can be a great source of initial inspiration.</li><li><strong>Competition:</strong> If there are other businesses already on Instagram who are in your niche, maybe who have a sizeable following already, they may well already be leveraging a hashtag strategy which you can learn from. Visit their account and see which hashtags they use on a regular basis. If they’re posting the same tags over and over again, there’s a good chance they’ve already done a bit of trial and error research and have discovered the ones that work.</li><li><strong>Related:</strong> If you’ve got a hashtag or two already that you get good engagement from, visit the pages for those hashtags and see what else is posted alongside them. There may be other hashtag trends relating to your business that you haven’t thought of yet, and could try including in future posts.</li><li><strong>Influencers:</strong> Who are the biggest influencers in your industry? Is there a blogger who simply loves products like yours? If so, check out what hashtags they use, and follow along with their favorites to reach the people who follow them. Their audience is essentially the same as yours, so why not learn from the experts?</li></ul><p>Avoid using ‘spammy’ hashtags such as #like4like, #followme, #follow4follow and #followback. These are insanely popular among low quality Instagramers who simply want more followers, without caring about the quality. Stick to carefully chosen, related hashtags to gain valuable followers for your business.</p><h4 id="6-How-many-hashtags-should-you-use"><a href="#6-How-many-hashtags-should-you-use" class="headerlink" title="6.  How many hashtags should you use?"></a>6.  How many hashtags should you use?</h4><p>No doubt you’ve uncovered a great list of potential hashtags for your Instagram posts, but how many should you use in each posting? Instagram is less strict than Twitter, in that you can use up to 30 hashtags per post. However, that doesn’t mean you should go all out on every post, so how many is enough?</p><p>For some insight into the ‘norm’, you can take a look at influencers and competitors and see how many hashtags they tend to use. You can also conduct a bit of trial and error testing to see how to use hashtags on Instagram to their full effect, by varying the number you use and tracking the results.</p><p>Research conducted last year found that there is certainly a case for the more the merrier. Buffer discovered that engagement was greatest on posts with 11 hashtags, at 79.5 per cent compared to just 29 per cent for one. A separate study by TrackMaven found that nine hashtags performed best.</p><p>As a general rule, there is no rule. Optimum hashtag numbers will depend on your industry, but there’s no need to be stingy as more definitely is more. Remember to test and adapt to the response you are getting to make hashtags work for your brand.</p><h4 id="7-How-to-get-onto-Top-Posts"><a href="#7-How-to-get-onto-Top-Posts" class="headerlink" title="7.  How to get onto Top Posts"></a>7.  How to get onto Top Posts</h4><p>Getting bumped up to a Top Post is the holy grail of how to hashtag on Instagram. There are a few things you can do to maximize your chances of getting your post into the spotlight.</p><ul><li><strong>Pick the right hashtags:</strong> If you want to trend for a hashtag, avoid the massive tags unless you already have more than 10k followers. Something like #dietgoals is more likely to steer you towards a top post than something huge like #instafood.</li><li><strong>Punch for maximum engagement:</strong> Focus on getting high levels of engagement as quickly as possible by scheduling your post to go live when your audience is most active. Research your target market, consider time zones and use a scheduling tool to optimize your post if you can’t be online at precisely the right time.</li><li><strong>Add some biggies too:</strong> Using between three and five of the really big hashtags are likely to boost engagement too. You aren’t likely to hit the top post for these, but should acquire a ton of likes and comments, which will help your target hashtag to rank higher too.</li></ul><p>Breaking into the top posts takes some dedication, trial and error and a good level of commitment. It’s all dependent on the Instagram algorithm, the workings of which is a closely guarded secret, but by following these tips you’ll give your post the best chance of success.</p><p>Now you know not only how to hashtag on Instagram, but also why and which ones to use. Why not try reviewing your hashtag strategy and see what results you can get?

On the same day IGTV app that makes sharing videos on your IGTV channel easier was also launched, so you don’t even have to use the Instagram app to post new content to your channel. In case you’re not familiar with the IGTV app and you don’t know how to upload videos to your channel you’ve come to the right place, because in this article we are going to take you through all the steps you’ll need to take in order to upload a video to IGTV.</p><h3 id="Make-Your-IGTV-Marketing-Videos-Shine"><a href="#Make-Your-IGTV-Marketing-Videos-Shine" class="headerlink" title="Make Your IGTV Marketing Videos Shine"></a>Make Your IGTV Marketing Videos Shine</h3><p>Recently, video marketing has become an unstoppable trend.

Naturally, in order to be able to use IGTV, you must have an Instagram account, so before you take any other steps, make sure that you are signed in to your account on Instagram.</p><h4 id="Creating-an-IGTV-Channel"><a href="#Creating-an-IGTV-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Creating an IGTV Channel"></a>Creating an IGTV Channel</h4><p>Launch the Instagram app, and then tap on the <strong>Settings icon</strong> located in the upper right corner. Pick the <strong>Create Channel</strong> option and that is it, you will now be able to add videos to your IGTV channel or browse and watch videos other creators post on their channels.</p><h4 id="Uploading-Videos-to-IGTV-Using-the-Instagram-or-the-IGTV-app"><a href="#Uploading-Videos-to-IGTV-Using-the-Instagram-or-the-IGTV-app" class="headerlink" title="Uploading Videos to IGTV Using the Instagram or the IGTV app"></a>Uploading Videos to IGTV Using the Instagram or the IGTV app</h4><p>It doesn’t really matter which of these two apps you decide to use to upload videos to your IGTV channel, because the process is identical. Simply tap on the <strong>IGTV icon</strong> that looks like, well, a TV with an antenna and then tap on the <strong>+ icon</strong> to add a video from your camera roll. Keep in mind that videos that last more than a couple of minutes can be huge in size and that it might be better to upload videos to your IGTV channel from a computer if the video is larger than one or two gigabytes.</p><p>Write a description of the video and give it a catchy title before hitting the <strong>Post button</strong>. Optionally, you can <strong>enable the share to Facebook option</strong> even before you post the video to your IGTV channel, but you can also share a video to different social media platforms after you posted it to IGTV.</p><h4 id="Uploading-Videos-to-IGTV-from-a-Computer"><a href="#Uploading-Videos-to-IGTV-from-a-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Uploading Videos to IGTV from a Computer"></a>Uploading Videos to IGTV from a Computer</h4><p>Open your web browser and head over to <strong>instagram.com.</strong> If you’re not already signed in, you’ll be asked to provide the <strong>login information</strong>, so once you’ve inserted your <strong>username and password</strong> you’ll be able to see your Instagram feed. Click on the icon located next to the heart-shaped icon that displays all the notifications, located in the top right corner, in order to gain access to your Instagram channel.</p><p>Proceed to click on the <strong>IGTV icon</strong>, and then click on the <strong>Upload button</strong>. Once a new page loads you can <strong>upload a cover photo</strong> or add a <strong>description and a title</strong>. On the left side of the screen you will be able to see a <strong>+ icon</strong> and below it, you’ll see the <strong>Drag and Drop a Video File</strong> message. You can either <strong>drag and drop</strong> a video file from a folder to the designated area of the screen or you can click on the <strong>+ icon</strong> and navigate to the folder in which the file you want to upload is located. If you would like to <strong>share the video on Facebook and IGTV at the same time</strong>, you must first <strong>connect your IGTV to your Facebook page</strong>. Afterward, you should simply <strong>click on the IGTV and Facebook page option</strong> to enable it and proceed to click on the Post button and the bottom of the screen.</p><h4 id="Video-Upload-Requirements-for-IGTV"><a href="#Video-Upload-Requirements-for-IGTV" class="headerlink" title="Video Upload Requirements for IGTV"></a>Video Upload Requirements for IGTV</h4><p>Even though IGTV videos can last up to <strong>sixty minutes</strong>, this option is <strong>reserved for verified accounts.</strong> Regular IGTV creators can only upload videos that <strong>last from fifteen seconds up to ten minutes.</strong> In addition, you can only upload <strong>MP4 video</strong> files to your IGTV channel, since the platform <strong>doesn’t support any other video file format</strong> at the moment.</p><p>Currently, the size of a video can’t exceed <strong>560 MB</strong> for videos between <strong>15 seconds and ten minutes,</strong> while the maximum file size for a sixty-minute videos is limited to <strong>3.6 GB</strong>. IGTV videos have to be vertical, and the content you upload must have a minimum <strong>4:5 aspect ratio, while the maximum aspect ratio is 9:16.</strong></p><h2 id="Tips-for-Uploading-and-Posting-Videos-to-IGTV"><a href="#Tips-for-Uploading-and-Posting-Videos-to-IGTV" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Uploading and Posting Videos to IGTV"></a>Tips for Uploading and Posting Videos to IGTV</h2><p>Despite the fact that you can now upload videos that last for an entire hour, it is still better to keep the content you share on your IGTV channel short. Videos that <strong>last between two and five minutes</strong> are best suited for the audience on social media. Posting videos that surpass the five-minute limit can prove to be counterproductive because people won’t take the time to watch them from start to finish.</p><p>Aside from YouTube, a majority of videos on social media platforms are watched without sound. That’s why adding subtitles to your video may be a good idea, but just remember that you have to hardcode the subtitles into the video since SRT files don’t work well with vertical videos.</p><h2 id="Analyzing-and-Promoting-an-IGTV-Channel"><a href="#Analyzing-and-Promoting-an-IGTV-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Analyzing and Promoting an IGTV Channel"></a>Analyzing and Promoting an IGTV Channel</h2><p>After uploading a video to IGTV you can monitor the number of <strong>likes, comments, and views</strong> by tapping on the <strong>‘three dots’ icon</strong> located next to the <strong>Like, Comment and Share icons</strong> on a particular video. A <strong>drop-down menu will appear</strong> on the screen and you should tap on the <strong>View Insights</strong> option in order to see how many <strong>views, likes and comments</strong> your video got. Below the <strong>Engagement information</strong>, you can find the <strong>Audience Retention</strong> menu that offers <strong>Average Percentage Watch</strong> information as well as <strong>a drop-off graph</strong> that tells you at which point viewers stop watching your video. The data provided by the IGTV analytics can be extremely valuable when planning future posts on IGTV. Moreover, you can use conventional tools for content promotion on Instagram to increase the number of views your IGTV videos are getting.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>In the first six months after its initial launch IGTV seems like it has made Instagram more entertaining because it encourages creators to post captivating videos people around the globe love watching. Hopefully, we have provided you with all the information you’re going to need to upload your first video to IGTV.

You can save the stories as well as categorize the content by creating a highlight of your story. By doing so, other users can quickly access those stories based upon the label given. In this article, I will show you how to create highlights in 3 different ways.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-A-Highlight-on-Instagram-from-an-Active-Story"><a href="#How-to-Create-A-Highlight-on-Instagram-from-an-Active-Story" class="headerlink" title="How to Create A Highlight on Instagram from an Active Story?"></a>How to Create A Highlight on Instagram from an Active Story?</h2><p>To make a highlight on Instagram, you can create an image or icon for a topic or genre for their stories. The intention of the highlights is to show instantaneously to viewers of your profile the content of your stories or brand, making navigation to your content easier. Before you can create your highlight, however, you will need to have a story on your profile. Create the story which you wish to highlight. Then go to the story which you have created to view it.</p><p>Once the active story has been selected, you will find an option at the bottom of the story besides the More menu to create a highlight. Click on the option Highlight. This is not how to make a highlight on Instagram but access the menu to do so. When you enter the highlight option, click on the plus sign to create a new highlight.

After the first highlight has been made, you can create additional highlights and name them accordingly simply by clicking the new button.</p><p>If a highlight does not show up on your profile, check that you have a unique name for the highlight and that you have followed all of the steps needed to create the graphic, naming, and story selections properly. Remember it is best not to have too many highlights on your profile as this could cause confusion for the visitor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-highlight-profile.jpg"                      alt="  Instagram Highlight Profile"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Use-Highlights-and-Story-Links-to-Increase-Conversions"><a href="#How-to-Use-Highlights-and-Story-Links-to-Increase-Conversions" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Highlights and Story Links to Increase Conversions?"></a>How to Use Highlights and Story Links to Increase Conversions?</h2><p>Generally, stories disappear after 24 hours if they are just posted to your profile. The ability to create highlights puts the stories into the profile until the highlight is deleted using the methods previously mentioned. If you happen to forget to add a story to your highlights within 24 hours, you can still access the story in your archives. Instagram automatically archives stories, meaning that the content you wish to save for a later date can be kept in the archive until you wish to put that material into a highlight.</p><p>Highlights ensure that visitors to your Instagram do not have to scroll through the content of your profile to find information concerning your brand. Additionally, by creating content-saturated Highlights, you set the tone for the viewer.</p><p>Businesses should understand how to create a highlight on Instagram as the potential for conversions is substantial when using them. Primarily, the highlight feature allows a business or a brand to re-introduce a story as new content with new promotional links. This means that stories which in the past showed a high user interaction can be reused and increase SERPs for that content for your brand. Use the methods on how to create highlights on Instagram from archives or how to make highlights on Instagram to showcase your stories.</p><p>Although the highlights are essential to brand building and conversions, they should be coupled with the Swipe-up feature, tap-to-view link features, and the content therein. Brands that have annual or semi-annual events should merge bits from prior stories with new content.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Instagram has over 200 million daily views making it the perfect platform for visual branding and sharing content. Categorizing your stories and content in a concise method is fundamental to establishing a high level of conversions. Highlights which appear on your profile under your bio are the best way in which to share stories and otherwise archived content with your viewers.</p><p>By following these simple methods of how to make a highlight on Instagram, whether you wish to do so for professional purposes or just to organize your stories on your personal account, you will find more interaction and more content-driven reactions to your profile.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unleash-your-social-media-potential-with-insta-post-magic/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Unleash Your Social Media Potential with Insta Post Magic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-expedited-guide-to-distinguishing-genuine-followers-on-instagram/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Expedited Guide to Distinguishing Genuine Followers on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-mastering-multiperspective-media-expert-guide-to-instagram-video-rotations/"><u>[New] In 2024, Mastering Multiperspective Media  Expert Guide to Instagram Video Rotations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-crafting-your-vocal-image-for-instagrams-dynamic-features/"><u>In 2024, Crafting Your Vocal Image for Instagram’s Dynamic Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-understanding-instagram-video-count-constraints/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Understanding Instagram  Video Count Constraints</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-insider-secrets-mastering-unseen-social-media-features/"><u>[New] Insider Secrets  Mastering Unseen Social Media Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-a-guide-to-the-finest-apps-for-instagram-reel-creation/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  A Guide to the Finest Apps for Instagram Reel Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/expert-strategies-for-3d-lut-implementation-in-photoshop-for-2024/"><u>Expert Strategies for 3D LUT Implementation in Photoshop for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-from-wireless-broadcasts-to-digital-downloads-top-3-ways-to-convert-podcasts-into-mp3s/"><u>Updated From Wireless Broadcasts to Digital Downloads Top 3 Ways to Convert Podcasts Into MP3s</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-a-visual-guide-to-subtitling-techniques-for-effective-dialogue-placement-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] A Visual Guide to Subtitling  Techniques for Effective Dialogue Placement for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/2024-approved-comprehensive-insights-for-optimal-iphone-x-animoji-use/"><u>2024 Approved  Comprehensive Insights for Optimal iPhone X Animoji Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/5-easy-ways-to-change-location-on-youtube-tv-on-infinix-note-30-vip-racing-edition-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>5 Easy Ways to Change Location on YouTube TV On Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/crafting-wisdom-for-the-virtual-realm-30plus-metaverse-quotes/"><u>Crafting Wisdom for the Virtual Realm  30+ Metaverse Quotes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-top-criteria-for-evaluating-video-to-audio-conversion-tools/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Top Criteria for Evaluating Video to Audio Conversion Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-hourly-high-stakes-views-yts-1-to-10-rankings/"><u>2024 Approved  Hourly High-Stakes Views  YT's #1 to #10 Rankings</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Once you open IGTV on your iPhone, you will be able to see the videos the platform suggests you should watch in <strong>the For You</strong> section. When you come across an IGTV video you no longer want to see, simply <strong>swipe down</strong>, and then <strong>tap on the three-dot icon</strong> that is located next to the Like, Comment and Share buttons.</p><p> A four-option menu will pop up on the screen, so you just have to <strong>tap on the Hide feature</strong>, and the platform will immediately remove the video you no longer want to see and the next video will start playing automatically.</p><p> The process of reporting an IGTV video from an Android device is nearly identical to the process of hiding a video on an iPhone. <strong>The only difference is</strong>, that you should select the <strong>Report option</strong> in the menu that pops up on the screen after you tap on the three dot icon. Using the Hide or Report options will enable IGTV to understand what type of content you like. That’s why you shouldn’t hesitate to use these options every time you see a video that covers a topic you’re not interested in or if you find its content offensive.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Optimizing IGTV in accordance with your interests and tastes doesn’t require much effort, as you can easily hide or report IGTV videos you don’t want to interact with. Moreover, you can get rid of IGTV notifications in case they interrupt you too often while you are browsing through your Instagram feed. Hopefully, this article will help make the experience of using IGTV more enjoyable for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-decoding-music-copyright-rules-in-the-world-of-instagram/"><u>[New] In 2024, Decoding Music Copyright Rules in the World of Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-exploring-the-undiscovered-facets-of-story-viewing/"><u>2024 Approved  Exploring the Undiscovered Facets of Story Viewing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-add-subtitles-to-igtv-videos/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  How to Add Subtitles to IGTV Videos?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-effortless-photo-series-display-on-ig/"><u>In 2024, Effortless Photo Series Display on IG</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-anonymity-in-action-insta-stories-guide-for-2024/"><u>[New] Anonymity in Action  Insta Stories Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-transform-your-igtv-backgrounds-with-style-for-2024/"><u>[New] Transform Your IGTV Backgrounds with Style for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-understanding-instagrams-video-limit-policy-for-2024/"><u>[New] Understanding Instagram's Video Limit Policy for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-topics.techidaily.com/updated-what-is-ai-pixel-art-generator/"><u>Updated What Is AI Pixel Art Generator?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/in-2024-get-started-with-jaycut-a-beginners-guide-to-free-video-editing/"><u>In 2024, Get Started with Jaycut A Beginners Guide to Free Video Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-your-step-by-step-roadmap-for-instagrams-latest-feature-sharing-gifs-for-2024/"><u>[New] Your Step-by-Step Roadmap for Instagram's Latest Feature - Sharing GIFs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-average-profit-per-million-youtube-viewers/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Average Profit per Million YouTube Viewers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop-a-beginners-guide/"><u>New 2024 Approved Create Risograph Effect In Photoshop A Beginners Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/new-mp4-video-editing-made-easy-a-comprehensive-guide-for-mac-and-windows/"><u>New MP4 Video Editing Made Easy A Comprehensive Guide for Mac and Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/new-profit-potential-unveiled-making-money-via-youtube/"><u>[New] Profit Potential Unveiled  Making Money via YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/new-chromebook-video-editing-on-a-budget-10-free-options-for-2024/"><u>New Chromebook Video Editing on a Budget 10 Free Options for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-the-subscriber-youtube-connection-maximizing-engagement/"><u>[Updated] The Subscriber-YouTube Connection  Maximizing Engagement</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

You can pick any song that you like and add it as a background sound. However, when it comes to business accounts, there is a restriction.

The key is to search for a song with the words “Original Music.”</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Instagram Reels are beneficial for everyone.

Well, we understand your situation. Obviously, if you have to upload your photos or videos one at a time, it may feel quite boring and frustrating, especially when you have dozens of them lined up in the queue. But here’s the good news!</p><h2 id="Introducing-Carousel"><a href="#Introducing-Carousel" class="headerlink" title="Introducing Carousel"></a>Introducing Carousel</h2><p> Instagram’s update 10.9 for Android and iOS allows its users to upload upto 10 photos and videos in one go. This new feature is called ‘Carousel’. Basically, when you upload multiple photos via carousel, they appear in a single post in the feed. There will be a row of blue dots underneath the pictures to let others know that they can swipe left and right through the slideshow to view the photos.</p><p> You can now organize and post your photos about an expedition or some memorable event etc. in one single post and boast about your experiences in a more sequential and connective way to efficiently capture your audience’s attention. Since this feature lets you add a series of videos as well, you can incorporate up to 10 videos in a single post and hence post a video content for up to 10 minutes.</p><h2 id="How-to-Upload-Multiple-Videos-and-Photos-to-Instagram"><a href="#How-to-Upload-Multiple-Videos-and-Photos-to-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How to Upload Multiple Videos and Photos to Instagram"></a>How to Upload Multiple Videos and Photos to Instagram</h2><p> Here in this section we have brought you with the detailed guide on how one can upload up to 10 images or videos or a combination of both in a single Instagram post –</p><ul><li>Launch your Instagram app and hit the ‘+’ sign at the bottom.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-mutiple-photo-to-ins-1.png"                                     ></p><ul><li>As soon as you tap it, you will be able to see the recent photos and videos in your phone.

A number appears on the top right corner of every image which shows you the sequence in which they will be uploaded.
