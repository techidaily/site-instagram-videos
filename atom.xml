Even today, recording a portrait video and showing it in any other context other than the Internet can be viewed as amateurish and embarrassing. However, the recently launched IGTV disregards all this, as it doesn’t allow its users to <strong>upload horizontal videos</strong> to its platform. What’s more, IGTV is rapidly growing in popularity, and the trend can be expected to continue in the foreseeable future. That’s why, in this article, we are going to show you <strong>three different ways of creating and sharing landscape videos on IGTV</strong>.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">IGTV Video Specs You Should Know Before Uploading a Video to Your Channel</a></li><li><a href="#part2">How to Upload a Landscape Video to IGTV from a Mac or a PC computer?</a></li></ul><h2 id="IGTV-Video-Specs-You-Should-Know-Before-Uploading-a-Video-to-Your-Channel"><a href="#IGTV-Video-Specs-You-Should-Know-Before-Uploading-a-Video-to-Your-Channel" class="headerlink" title="IGTV Video Specs You Should Know Before Uploading a Video to Your Channel"></a>IGTV Video Specs You Should Know Before Uploading a Video to Your Channel</h2><p>Instagram is famous for severely limiting the options its users have at their disposal because it only allowed them to post square-shaped photos for years. IGTV seems to be following the same pattern, not only because you can’t upload horizontally oriented videos, but also because your videos must be in <strong>MP4 format</strong>. Yes, that’s right, the platform currently doesn’t support any other video file format.</p><p>Even though you can now share videos that last up to ten minutes or an entire hour if you own a verified account, <strong>the platform also limits the maximum size of video files</strong> you can upload to your IGTV channel. <strong>A ten-minute video can’t be larger than 650MB</strong>, while the size of videos that last one hour can’t exceed <strong>3.6 GB</strong>. In addition, your IGTV videos can only have aspect ratios that range from <strong>4:5 up to 9:16</strong>. These specs make it easy to see why all the content you post on IGTV has to be created specifically for this platform.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >What is IGTV and How to Use It: Everything You Need to Know&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Download&#x2F;Save Instagram Photos&#x2F;Videos on iPhone&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Save-Instagram-photos-videos-on-iPhone"><a href="#How-to-Save-Instagram-photos-videos-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="How to Save Instagram photos&#x2F;videos on iPhone"></a>How to Save Instagram photos&#x2F;videos on iPhone</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148640/16836" target="_top" id="2148640">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148640" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="234" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148640/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Upload-a-Landscape-Video-to-IGTV-from-a-Mac-or-a-PC-computer"><a href="#How-to-Upload-a-Landscape-Video-to-IGTV-from-a-Mac-or-a-PC-computer" class="headerlink" title="How to Upload a Landscape Video to IGTV from a Mac or a PC computer?"></a>How to Upload a Landscape Video to IGTV from a Mac or a PC computer?</h2><p>If you already have an Instagram account, you can upload your videos to IGTV directly from your computer.

This means that you can use Mac and PC-based video editing software products to edit your videos before you share them on IGTV.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/863035/11832" target="_top" id="863035">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-863035" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/863035/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Using-Filmora-Video-Editor-to-Edit-IGTV-Videos"><a href="#Using-Filmora-Video-Editor-to-Edit-IGTV-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Using Filmora Video Editor to Edit IGTV Videos"></a>Using Filmora Video Editor to Edit IGTV Videos</h3><p>If you decide to edit the videos you want to upload to IGTV on a Mac or a PC computer, then we suggest using the Filmora video editor, because it offers all the tools you’re going to need to create a landscape video you can share on your IGTV channel.</p><p>Check out our video guide about how to edit videos for Instagram.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139113/17108" target="_top" id="2139113">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139113" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139113/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Here is the process in word format in case you don’t have time to check the video.</p><p><strong>Create a new project</strong>, and then when the new project loads head over the <strong>File menu</strong> and choose the <strong>Project Settings</strong> option. Click on the <strong>Resolution drop-down menu</strong> and then select the <strong>720x1280 (9:16)</strong> option. Make sure to change <strong>the Frame Rate to 30FPS</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong> to confirm the changes you made.</p><p>Import the video you’d like to edit into Filmora by either dragging it from a folder on your computer and dropping it to the <strong>Media panel</strong>, or by clicking on the <strong>Import drop-down menu</strong> and selecting the <strong>Import Media Files</strong> option. Once you’ve imported the video file into the editor, you should place it on the timeline.</p><p>Head back to the <strong>File menu</strong>, and click on the <strong>Preferences</strong> option, or use the <strong>CTRL+Shit+,</strong> keyboard shortcut to bring up the <strong>Preferences window</strong>. Click on the <strong>Editing tab</strong> and select the <strong>Crop to Fit</strong> option from the <strong>Photo Placement drop-down menu</strong>.</p><p>You can then cut the video, change its duration or enhance its colors, before heading over to the <strong>Effects tab</strong>. The <strong>Filters menu</strong> contains the <strong>Background Blur folder</strong>, so you should just click on it and select the Background Blur you like the most. By doing so, you will cover the black areas of the video and make it more aesthetically pleasing.</p><p>Optionally, you can <strong>take a snapshot of your video</strong> by clicking on the <strong>Photo Camera icon</strong> located below the <strong>Preview Window</strong> in order to create a cover photo for your IGTV video. When done, you should click on the Export button, make sure to <strong>change the output format to MP4</strong>, and wait for the rendering process to be completed.</p><p>Once your video is exported from Filmora, you should go to Instagram.com, click on the IGTV icon on your profile page and upload the horizontal video to your IGTV channel.</p><h2 id="Using-the-Instagram-App-to-Upload-Horizontal-Videos-to-IGTV-from-Smartphones"><a href="#Using-the-Instagram-App-to-Upload-Horizontal-Videos-to-IGTV-from-Smartphones" class="headerlink" title="Using the Instagram App to Upload Horizontal Videos to IGTV from Smartphones"></a>Using the Instagram App to Upload Horizontal Videos to IGTV from Smartphones</h2><p>In case you’d just like to post a video to your IGTV channel, you can use the Instagram app to quickly create a horizontally oriented video. <strong>The stories editor</strong> enables you to accomplish this, but you should keep in mind that this solution only works if the duration of a video doesn’t exceed the <strong>15-second limit</strong>.</p><p>So once you launch the Instagram app, you should <strong>open the story editor</strong> and then tap on the <strong>Add button</strong>. This will enable you to select the video you’d like to edit.</p><p>After you’ve selected the video you’ll be able to see <strong>two arrows on the screen</strong>. <strong>Use your fingers to rotate the video</strong> and change its orientation from vertical to horizontal. Your video should occupy the <strong>middle of the screen</strong>, while the areas above and below the video should be blurred.</p><p>Tap on the <strong>Save icon</strong> to confirm the changes and proceed to upload the video to your IGTV channel.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657399/16446" target="_top" id="1657399">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657399" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657399/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Creating-a-Horizontal-Video-from-a-Mobile-Device-with-GoPro-Splice"><a href="#Creating-a-Horizontal-Video-from-a-Mobile-Device-with-GoPro-Splice" class="headerlink" title="Creating a Horizontal Video from a Mobile Device with GoPro Splice"></a>Creating a Horizontal Video from a Mobile Device with GoPro Splice</h2><p>iPhone users can easily create landscape videos for their IGTV channels with GoPro’s <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/splice-video-editor-maker/id409838725?mt=8" >Splice <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app. You can <strong>download the app for free from the App Store</strong> and you won’t have to make any in-app purchases after you install Splice on your device.</p><p>Keep in mind that it is better to complete all other editing tasks before you start reformatting your video. Simply <strong>create a new project</strong>, select the video you’d like to share on your IGTV channel, and tap on <strong>the Add button</strong>. A new window will load, where you will be asked if you want to add music to your video, so if your video already has a soundtrack you can skip this step.</p><p>The app will then take you to the <strong>Project Settings</strong> window and you should just tap on the <strong>Format option</strong> and change it from <strong>Portrait to Landscape</strong>. Optionally, you can <strong>switch off the Outro option</strong> that is enabled by default or you can change the background color. Tap on the <strong>Done button</strong>, when ready, and proceed to export your video. Even though Splice offers the option to export videos directly to Instagram, you won’t be able to upload the video to your IGTV channel. So just save the video to your camera roll, and use the Instagram or IGTV app to upload the file to IGTV.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>None of the options for creating vertical videos for IGTV are perfect because each of them leaves portions of the frame empty. Basically, you will be creating a vertically oriented frame with a 9:16 aspect ratio, that contains a centrally positioned and horizontally oriented video. This is only a good option if the video you want to upload to IGTV doesn’t make any sense when it is vertically oriented, which can be the case more often than you’d expect.

In order to increase the visibility of your posts on Instagram, you should strive to find the best time for sharing a post. The rule of thumb says that the best time to share a post on Instagram is when the majority of your followers is enjoying their free time because that is when they are most likely to use this social media platform. Generally speaking early mornings, lunch hours and evenings between 19:00 and 21:00 are the best times for posting on Instagram, but each year the best time for posting on Instagram changes.</p><p> Things are further complicated by the fact that each Instagram account has a unique set of followers, which means that the best time to share a post on Instagram may be different for two relatively similar accounts. In this article, we are going to show you how to find out when is the best time to post on Instagram, and we are going to recommend a few scheduling tools you are going to need if you want to make sure that your posts are always perfectly timed.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">The Best Time to Post on Instagram</a></li><li><a href="#part2">How to Find Your Own Best Time to Post on Instagram</a></li><li><a href="#part3">The Tools You’re Going to Need for Scheduling Posts on Instagram</a></li></ul><h2 id="The-Best-Time-to-Post-on-Instagram"><a href="#The-Best-Time-to-Post-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="The Best Time to Post on Instagram"></a>The Best Time to Post on Instagram</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/best-time-post-on-insta.jpg"                                     ></p><p> Image resource: mentionlytics.com</p><p> There is no recipe for success, but following certain guidelines can be useful if you want to extend the reach of your posts on Instagram. Despite the fact that social media researchers often come up with conflicting reports regarding the best time to share a post on Instagram, most of them agree that Mondays and Thursdays are the best days to post new content on Instagram.</p><p> Furthermore, several research studies suggest that Mondays are the most effective and that posts shared on this day of the week create better engagement and have better conversion rates. Thursdays, on the other hand, are the most popular day for posting content on Instagram, which suggests that your posts will have a better reach if you share them during the peak hours on this day of the week.</p><p> Nevertheless, there are no strict guidelines regarding the hours of the day, when it is best to post new content to Instagram on these days, but the time frame between 15:00 and 16:00 should be avoided during the working days of the week. Instagram’s algorithm favors posts that get a lot of likes and comments, but it also factors in the amount of time it takes a post to get those likes and comments. In this manner, the algorithm recognizes high-quality posts and shows them to even more Instagram users.</p><p> Coming up with the ways in which you can use the Instagram’s algorithm to your own advantage and discovering the best time to share a post on your account is not an exact science. However, there are certain general rules that apply to nearly all Instagrammers.</p><h3 id="The-general-rules-to-follow"><a href="#The-general-rules-to-follow" class="headerlink" title="The general rules to follow"></a>The general rules to follow</h3><ul><li><strong>Don’t forget about the time zones</strong></li></ul><p> This is a fairly simple rule that suggests that you should know your Instagram followers well enough to post for a time zone in which the majority of them lives. If your target market is in Asia or North America, then you should schedule posts for peak hours in their time zone, even if that means that you have to share posts in odd hours.</p><ul><li><strong>Share important posts on weekdays</strong></li></ul><p> Even though the differences in the engagement percentages of posts shared on weekends and weekdays are marginal, the statistics show that posts shared on Instagram on a Sunday drives less traffic than the one shared on a Wednesday or a Thursday.</p><ul><li><strong>Don’t post during the working hours</strong></li></ul><p> We all lead busy lives and most of us don’t have the time for social media during the working hours. The period between 13:00h and 14:00h is a popular time for sharing posts on Instagram, but posting a photo or a video to this social media platform between 19:00 and 21:00 pm will produce the best results.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047411/19272" target="_top" id="2047411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047411/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Scheduling-Instagram-Posts-for-Individuals"><a href="#Scheduling-Instagram-Posts-for-Individuals" class="headerlink" title="Scheduling Instagram Posts for Individuals"></a>Scheduling Instagram Posts for Individuals</h3><p> Finding the best time to reach your followers is going to take a certain amount of time until you finally come up with the best time to post on Instagram. Statistics can only partially help you in this endeavor since each account on Instagram is different and each company has different demographics, targets different markets and has different goals for their social media marketing campaigns.</p><p> Your own experience will tell you when the best time is to share a post on Instagram because you’ll be able to see when the posts that got the most attention were shared. Following the what the experts and their studies are saying blindly is not a good strategy because you can’ know how big the test group was or what were the findings of a study based on.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1938136">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938136.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1938136">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938136.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1938136%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1938136/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Find-Your-Own-Best-Time-to-Post-on-Instagram"><a href="#How-to-Find-Your-Own-Best-Time-to-Post-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How to Find Your Own Best Time to Post on Instagram"></a>How to Find Your Own Best Time to Post on Instagram</h2><p> Define your target group, and learn as much as you can about the people you are trying to reach. Who are they? Where do they live? College students have very different lifestyles than the people working 9 to 5 jobs, so an Instagram account that offers sports gear to young people will naturally have different peak time than the account that sells office equipment. The more you learn about the habits of your Instagram followers the easier it gets to find the best day and time to post on your Instagram account.</p><p> Experimenting and trying to post on Instagram at different times, will show you when the best time is to share a post on your Instagram account. Once you find the peak hours for your Instagram account, you can use tools that enable you to schedule posts. However, sharing posts at the exactly the same time every day can be counterproductive, so in order to ensure the growth of your Instagram account, keep an open mind and try out new things from time to time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/1001453/11832" target="_top" id="1001453">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-1001453" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/1001453/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Tools-You’re-Going-to-Need-for-Scheduling-Posts-on-Instagram"><a href="#The-Tools-You’re-Going-to-Need-for-Scheduling-Posts-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="The Tools You’re Going to Need for Scheduling Posts on Instagram"></a>The Tools You’re Going to Need for Scheduling Posts on Instagram</h2><p> Recently, Instagram has introduced the Schedule option that allows you to schedule posts in advance directly from the platform.

Check out our three key steps for how to start a live video on Instagram and have a go at your first stream too.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Start-Instagram-live-streaming"><a href="#Step-1-Start-Instagram-live-streaming" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Start Instagram live streaming"></a>Step 1: Start Instagram live streaming</h3><p>You might think it’s obvious how to go live on Instagram, but it’s actually not as straightforward as you might think. To start an Instagram broadcast you need to begin by tapping on the ‘Your Story’ photo at the top of the menu. You’ll see a little plus sign next to it in blue. If you’ve been scrolling through your feed then this bar may have disappeared, in which case you’ll need to tap the camera button at the top left to bring it back again.</p><p>Now you should be in your story menu, which will let you choose one of three available options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/go-live-on-insta.jpg"                                     ></p><ul><li><strong>Live:</strong> This is Instagram live streaming, which disappears instantly once the broadcast is complete.</li><li><strong>Normal:</strong> Here you can add a photo or video which will be available for 24 hours</li><li><strong>Boomerang:</strong> This is for uploading a batch of photos which are stitched together to create a time-lapse type video</li></ul><p>For the purposes of Instagram live streaming, you’ll need to slide on over to the ‘Live’ option.</p><p>Before you begin broadcasting, however, check out your settings to ensure the right people can (or can’t) see the broadcast. You can also edit who is allowed to message you about this story, and block anyone you know to be a troll, for example. The ‘save shared photos’ setting does not work on your live streams, however, you can save your broadcast to your camera roll once you’ve finished the stream, thanks to a <a class="link"   href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/20/you-can-now-save-your-instagram-live-streams-to-your-camera-roll/" >feature <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>introduced by Instagram last year.</p><p>Now you’re all set. Check that your camera is pointing the right way, take a deep breath, and hit ‘Start Live Video’ once you’re sure you’re ready to start.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Manage-the-stream"><a href="#Step-2-Manage-the-stream" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Manage the stream"></a>Step 2: Manage the stream</h4><p>When thinking about how to go live on Instagram, it’s worth considering how you will manage your broadcast whilst in full flow. There are a few key settings built into Instagram which will help you to do this:</p><ul><li><strong>Viewer count:</strong> Up in the top right corner of your screen, you’ll see a number next to an eye. This tells you how many people are currently watching your stream. Keeping an eye on when people exit or join will give you some indication of how engaging they are finding your content.</li><li><strong>Comments:</strong> At the bottom, you’ll see a comment field, which will display comments made by your viewers. If you’re great at multi-tasking you can respond to comments as you go or ask people to message you their input, so you can reply to them after the stream. If you want to turn off commenting, tap the three dots in the bottom right corner.</li><li><strong>Likes:</strong> Viewers can express their love for your video in real-time, which you’ll see as a heart animation. Feel free to thank them and encourage additional likes where you can.</li><li><strong>Time broadcasting:</strong> Tap the little button that says ‘live’ to see how long your stream has been broadcasting.</li><li><strong>Block user:</strong> To see who’s watching, tap the little eye that is counting your viewers. If someone is becoming a nuisance, simply click the ‘x’ next to their name to remove them from your stream.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/go-live-on-insta-1.jpg"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134228/18498" target="_top" id="2134228">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134228" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134228/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Effective management of your stream is crucial, so ensure you are confident enough with what you want to cover in your broadcast that you can do this without interrupting your flow. Remember, there are no retakes with this type of content, so when planning how to start a live video on Instagram, make sure you dedicate enough time to the preparation to put you in a great position for an awesome video first time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484939/16446" target="_top" id="1484939">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484939" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484939/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-3-End-the-broadcast-and-wrap-it-up"><a href="#Step-3-End-the-broadcast-and-wrap-it-up" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: End the broadcast and wrap it up"></a>Step 3: End the broadcast and wrap it up</h3><p>To end your stream, simply hit the ‘end’ button in the top right of your screen. Instagram will return the limited analytics they hold for your stream, which is basically just the number of viewers. Unfortunately, Instagram Analytics doesn’t record data about your live streams, so it’s important to record this yourself for future reference. Either take a screenshot or note it down in some other way, so you can see how your different video topics return different results.</p><p>If you made any promises during your live stream, now is the time to keep them. Set aside a bit of time immediately after your video to follow up any direct messages, respond to any questions you might have had, and to send on any information as promised. Your followers will appreciate your swift response.</p><h2 id="How-to-make-good-use-of-Instagram-live-video-for-business"><a href="#How-to-make-good-use-of-Instagram-live-video-for-business" class="headerlink" title="How to make good use of Instagram live video for business"></a>How to make good use of Instagram live video for business</h2><p>It’s crucial to start figuring out how to go live on Instagram from a good, solid foundation.

Live streams really can be about anything, but some tried and tested formats work a little better than others. For example:</p><ul><li><strong>Q and A sessions:</strong> If you’ve got a product, service, or knowledge base to draw upon, invite interaction with your viewers for a session of questions and answers</li><li><strong>Instant feedback:</strong> Show you care and that you’re listening by inviting feedback on a new product or recent activity you’ve been involved with</li><li><strong>Behind the scenes:</strong> Viewers love to see how businesses operate, so why not take them on a tour of your warehouse or while you’re getting ready for a trade show?</li><li><strong>Tutorials and insight:</strong> Whatever your industry, you can be confident you know more than just about anyone else about what you do. Teach them how to use a product, give tips on getting the best from your service, or give them some insider tips that only you know</li><li><strong>Special guest features:</strong> You don’t have to have celebrity connections, but if you can rope in an influencer or brand to do an interview session with you, you’ll have double the traffic with your fans and theirs</li><li><strong>Comment on the comments:</strong> You’ll find a world of inspiration in your own direct messages and comments sections.

Make the most of every Instagram live streaming opportunity you get with our 11 awesome live video tips:</p><ul><li><strong>Check who has tuned in:</strong> You can find out who’s watching your feed by tapping the eye icon in the corner of the screen. Viewers love a bit of interaction, so if you’ve got a regular viewer or a username you recognize, be sure to give them a shout out to acknowledge their visit.</li><li><strong>Make sure people know what you’re broadcasting about:</strong> Being clear about what your video is covering is a great way to get people hooked, and to keep them there. You can do this easily by pinning a comment that describes or offers a ‘title’ for your live feed.</li><li><strong>Keep reminding them why they came here:</strong> Your viewers chose to watch your Instagram live streaming session because there was a nugget they wanted a piece of. Whether it’s a product reveal, a key piece of info, or a tutorial on something, keep reminding them why they’re watching to maintain interest and stop them from leaving.</li><li><strong>Request direct messages:</strong> If you’ve got a popular live stream going, the number of comments can be overwhelming, to say the least, and can interfere with the flow of the video. Ask people with specific questions or comments to DM your account and take the time to reply to all of them once you’ve finished.</li><li><strong>Change the view:</strong> You can make your live broadcast more engaging and interesting by switching what the viewers see from time to time. Do this by reversing the view of your camera, maybe to show off a product or to see what is around you.</li><li><strong>Say no to trolls:</strong> The internet is full of them, and it can be highly frustrating to have to deal with someone trying to disrupt your broadcast. Rather than turning off all the comments, which defeats part of the object of live streaming, click the ‘X’ next to the user’s name to mute their comments instead.</li><li><strong>Save the videos you make:</strong> We learn as we go, particularly with new activities that we don’t have much experience of, so don’t forget to save your video so you can watch it back later. Don’t beat yourself up when you view your own video but do take note of what you love and what you hate so you can improve for the future.</li><li><strong>Announce and follow up each live broadcast:</strong> Announce your plan to do some Instagram live streaming with a post or story, so people know where to come and when. After, you can create a follow-up post or story to share with those who couldn’t make it along to the live broadcast, highlighting what happened and letting them know when you’re streaming next.</li><li><strong>Answer all those questions:</strong> Remember you asked your viewers to DM your account with their specific questions or comments? Well, now you need to keep your promise and reply to all those messages! Set aside sometime straight after your stream to do this, so that they aren’t kept waiting for a reply.</li><li><strong>Note your results:</strong> Keep a record of how many people watched your broadcast, and other useful metrics such as how many direct messages you got, or product inquiries were generated. This will help you evaluate which videos work the best for you, and to play your Instagram live streaming activities for the future.</li><li><strong>Be cool and calm:</strong> You’ve got this. There’s no need to panic if things wander off-topic, or if everything is not going quite as you planned; just take a deep breath and steer things back in the direction you wanted. Remember; people have tuned in to see you being you, so relax, be yourself, and enjoy the moment.</li></ul><p>When you’re thinking about how to go live on Instagram with your business, product, or personality, keep these top tips in mind for a more successful outcome.

Vertical Video is necessary"></a>1. Vertical Video is necessary</h3><p> For Instagram TV (IGTV), it is important to have vertical videos. The old YouTube horizontal videos need you to rotate your screen to watch them properly. Fix the 1080X1920 pixels dimensions as that of Instagram Stories for IGTV videos. You can alternatively stick to the 9.16 aspect ratio for these IGTV vertical videos.</p><h3 id="2-Keep-It-Short"><a href="#2-Keep-It-Short" class="headerlink" title="2. Keep It Short"></a>2. Keep It Short</h3><p> Just because you have got a video limit of 10 minutes doesn’t mean you will pester the channel with anything and everything without bothering about the video length. Always keeping it short works, as people rarely stay interested beyond the initial 3-4 minutes of a video. Unless you belong to the film industry and have HD quality videos with breathtaking content don’t rush to post 30-40 minutes long ones. Anything between 2 to 5 minutes is worth.</p><h3 id="3-Don’t-Just-Repost-videos"><a href="#3-Don’t-Just-Repost-videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Don’t Just Repost videos"></a>3. Don’t Just Repost videos</h3><p> Unlike Instagram Stories, IGTV content is going to stay there beyond the 24 hours.

Mobile phones come with unique features that make life easier and more enjoyable.</p><p>Various software and applications have been developed and can be used to find solutions in many ways and in many industries.</p><p>With the advent of social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok, video creation has become increasingly important in many products and organizations.</p><p>Many business owners have found that there is a great deal of value in making engaging video content that can be costly and quality.</p><p>Many industries specialize in creating mind-boggling video content. But what happens when a beginner wishes to create something of the same effect, quality and attractiveness? A variety of applications can help beginners create great content without the need for office space or high-end devices. This little secret is iMovie.</p><p><strong>iMovie Square Video</strong></p><p>One software that works well within the digital space is a video editing application known as iMovie. It is a video editing software supported for macOS, iOS, and iPad OS devices.</p><p>This app was developed in the late 20th century in 1999 and features an easy-to-use interface with a timeline, a preview window, and a media browser.</p><p>Many experts consider iMovie to be a contemporary non-linear editor. With little or no technical experience, videos can be cut or edited without changing the original format of the file using its many features.</p><p>With the high cost of some editing apps, Movie seems to be a good choice for beginners. The Movie is accurate, just like any other Apple product. This software was created with the idea that not everyone is a great editor or expert.</p><p>iMovie is easy to use and with a bit of practice. A newbie can extract quality content and product engagement or personal use.</p><p><strong>Why Square Videos?</strong></p><p>It may surprise us, but square videos have recently received a lot of attention, and the reason for this is not forgotten.</p><p>One important reason for this popularity is that social media platforms such as Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram are the ideal square video games.</p><p>Square videos take up a lot of screen space, especially in viewer feeds, rather than landscape video. The more your screen takes the user’s screen, the better. It may interest you to know that the screen-filling videos are very attractive.</p><p>There are various benefits to using the iMovie app. As mentioned earlier, the app has features for adjusting and enlarging video color settings, cropping and rotating video clips, stabilizing unstable videos, and increasing video transitions (such as blurring and speed changes). Video clip effects include cropping, using a green&#x2F;blue screen to extract a title, replacing the background with a different clip, screen splitting, and making a photo-picture effect.</p><p>By removing background sound and raising audio levels for silent clips, iMovie can also help to convert and enhance video audio.</p><p>Movie trailers can be created using templates provided in iMovie. The trailer tool in iMovie makes it easy to drop clips on a timeline, separated by a panel board with labels indicating what type of clip should be placed in each window.</p><p>A guide to adding titles and credits to the cart is also included in the template. There is no doubt that using iMovie can get a beginner a unique video spark. It can get the industry any updates needed. Developers can use app previews to give users a quick overview of the app using video rather than graphics.</p><p>Let’s look at how to generate square movies for Instagram with iMovie now.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Square-Video-for-Instagram-in-iMovie-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Square-Video-for-Instagram-in-iMovie-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Make a Square Video for Instagram in iMovie on iPhone?"></a>Part 1. How to Make a Square Video for Instagram in iMovie on iPhone?</h2><p>Videos are a fantastic way to keep memories alive, but some social media platforms - specifically, Instagram - demand videos to be a certain size and length before they can be uploaded. Fortunately, cropping your video before sharing it is a straightforward process. Here are some pointers to help you crop a movie and modify the screen size to whatever you want. Cropping your films is useful for a variety of reasons. Perhaps you’d like to focus on a specific component of the film or get rid of your thumb from the screen’s corner. You’ll need iMovie, which comes preloaded on most iPhones, to crop a video on your iPhone. If your phone does not already have iMovie, you may get it for free from the App Store. The size or aspect ratio of your video will not change if you use this method.

How to Make a Square Video in iMovie on Mac?"></a>Part 2. How to Make a Square Video in iMovie on Mac?</h2><p>iMovie does not allow you to make square videos! You won’t be able to convert your video to square dimensions because there isn’t a way to do it. We’ll edit the video in iMovie and then modify the proportions in Keynote. Only Keynote will be used to crop the video into square dimensions. On Mac OS, Keynote is a presentation program that comes preloaded. First, use iMovie to edit your video as you typically would. Make all of the necessary modifications to the audio and video. Make use of iMovie’s special editing features. After you’ve finished editing the video, export it from iMovie.</p><p>Let’s adjust the dimensions of your video to square using Keynote now that you’ve edited and polished it in iMovie:</p><p><strong>Step #1.</strong> Select the “Basic White” theme from the Basic section of Keynote.</p><p><strong>Step #2.</strong> To select the text boxes, click and drag (or use “cmd + A”) them, then tap “delete”.</p><p><strong>Step #3.</strong> The video should now be dragged and dropped onto the blank slide. Click the <strong>Document</strong> tab in the top right corner of the screen, then pick “Custom Slide Size…” from the <strong>Slide Size</strong> dropdown menu.</p><p><strong>Step #4.</strong> To make a square video, make sure that both the width and height of the movie are the same. For example, if the video’s width is 500 pixels, the height should be 500 pixels as well. Once you’ve finished customizing the width and height of the slide, click “OK” to save it in these dimensions.</p><p><strong>Step #5.</strong> Drag one of your video’s corners out to make it fit the square proportions appropriately.</p><p><strong>Step #6.</strong> Click the <strong>Text</strong> button in the top center of the screen to add text to your square video. Simply drag and drop your logo or any other pictures into the video to add them.</p><p><strong>Step #7.</strong> To change the background color, first click on the white background area, then go to the <strong>Format</strong> tab in the top right corner and select a color from the <strong>Background</strong> section.</p><p><strong>Step #8.</strong> Finally, click “File” &gt; “Export To” &gt; “Movie…” to export the video. There will be a popup window. Choose a video resolution and then click <strong>Next</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step #9.</strong> Select a location to save your square video and then click <strong>Export</strong>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134242/18498" target="_top" id="2134242">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134242" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134242/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-How-to-Easily-Make-a-Square-Video-for-Social-Media-on-Mac"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-How-to-Easily-Make-a-Square-Video-for-Social-Media-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip - How to Easily Make a Square Video for Social Media on Mac?"></a>Bonus Tip - How to Easily Make a Square Video for Social Media on Mac?</h2><p>Facebook is dominating the top ranks in video consumption platforms across the internet, thanks to its high video consumption rate.

Well, we understand your situation. Obviously, if you have to upload your photos or videos one at a time, it may feel quite boring and frustrating, especially when you have dozens of them lined up in the queue. But here’s the good news!</p><h2 id="Introducing-Carousel"><a href="#Introducing-Carousel" class="headerlink" title="Introducing Carousel"></a>Introducing Carousel</h2><p> Instagram’s update 10.9 for Android and iOS allows its users to upload upto 10 photos and videos in one go. This new feature is called ‘Carousel’. Basically, when you upload multiple photos via carousel, they appear in a single post in the feed. There will be a row of blue dots underneath the pictures to let others know that they can swipe left and right through the slideshow to view the photos.</p><p> You can now organize and post your photos about an expedition or some memorable event etc. in one single post and boast about your experiences in a more sequential and connective way to efficiently capture your audience’s attention. Since this feature lets you add a series of videos as well, you can incorporate up to 10 videos in a single post and hence post a video content for up to 10 minutes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100534/7443" target="_top" id="2100534">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100534" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100534/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Upload-Multiple-Videos-and-Photos-to-Instagram"><a href="#How-to-Upload-Multiple-Videos-and-Photos-to-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How to Upload Multiple Videos and Photos to Instagram"></a>How to Upload Multiple Videos and Photos to Instagram</h2><p> Here in this section we have brought you with the detailed guide on how one can upload up to 10 images or videos or a combination of both in a single Instagram post –</p><ul><li>Launch your Instagram app and hit the ‘+’ sign at the bottom.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-mutiple-photo-to-ins-1.png"                                     ></p><ul><li>As soon as you tap it, you will be able to see the recent photos and videos in your phone.

It allowed Reels to be shared on Stories or via DMs. It is called Cenas in Brazil and is part of the Instagram Stories instead of a separate application.</p><h3 id="3-Instagram-reaches-over-1-Billion-users-every-month"><a href="#3-Instagram-reaches-over-1-Billion-users-every-month" class="headerlink" title="#3. Instagram reaches over 1 Billion users every month"></a>#3. Instagram reaches over 1 Billion users every month</h3><p>Instagram is a worldwide platform that reaches over a billion users every month. This number signifies how widespread its expansion is. Instagram is a site for everyone, be it a regular person, a business, or a celebrity. Its reach encourages people to make accounts and take different business or other initiatives with ease. Introducing the Reels feature will surely increase the number of users as it will attract users of TikTok as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-instagram-active-user.jpg"                      alt="instagram active user"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918698/19272" target="_top" id="1918698">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918698" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918698/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Instagram-Reels-is-available-in-50-countries-now"><a href="#4-Instagram-Reels-is-available-in-50-countries-now" class="headerlink" title="#4.

Much of this credit goes to the governments of these countries. In December 2019, Trump tried to get TikTok banned. When the position of TikTok was up for grabs, Facebook immediately acted upon it. Similarly, as TikTok has been banned in India, Instagram users are thrilled to get a similar platform where they can make multi-clip videos.</p><h3 id="6-NBA-franchises-are-very-active-on-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#6-NBA-franchises-are-very-active-on-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="#6.

Red Bull, Louis Vuitton, and Asos have also made Reels featuring their products, maximizing customer engagement. Finally, as mentioned above, NBA franchises are also making their contribution to the success of the Reels.</p><h3 id="8-Shopping-is-coming-to-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#8-Shopping-is-coming-to-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="#8.

These followers are somehow interested in your personality, posts, or what you show on your Instagram account. So, if you are an Instagram influencer, you would want to prevent people from unfollowing you. The best is by maintaining their expectations and hopes with your account. The following tips can assist you in preventing organic followers from unfollowing:</p><ul><li><strong>Going Live</strong></li></ul><p>One of the most effective ways is going live on Instagram to know what people expect from you. You can let your followers see the real you to maintain an excellent relationship with them.</p><ul><li><strong>Stay Active</strong></li></ul><p>If you are not staying active for whatever reason, there’s a high chance people will start unfollowing you. You need to keep your feed presence by posting more often to prevent the organic followers from unfollowing you.</p><ul><li><strong>Engage with audience</strong></li></ul><p>Start engaging with your follower, reply to their comments on your posts with interactive stickers. Otherwise, they would think that you are rude and will start unfollowing you. Also, try to engage on their posts as well.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2044585/7443" target="_top" id="2044585">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2044585" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2044585/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="FAQs-about-Instagram-Followers-Tracking"><a href="#FAQs-about-Instagram-Followers-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="FAQs about Instagram Followers Tracking"></a>FAQs about Instagram Followers Tracking</h3><h4 id="1-Are-you-notified-if-someone-unfollows-you-on-Instagram"><a href="#1-Are-you-notified-if-someone-unfollows-you-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="1. Are you notified if someone unfollows you on Instagram?"></a>1. Are you notified if someone unfollows you on Instagram?</h4><p>The obvious answer to this question is no. Instagram does not notify if someone has unfollowed you due to any reason. Instagram tends to keep its user’s privacy, and also it is against the application’s privacy policy. But if you still want to know, you can either check manually or use a third-party app.</p><h4 id="2-Is-it-immature-to-unfollow-someone-on-Instagram"><a href="#2-Is-it-immature-to-unfollow-someone-on-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="2.

If you don’t want to interact with someone or see their posts or stories, then it is mature to unfollow them for good. But to unfollow people for fun, then it is pretty immature.</p><h4 id="3-How-do-I-stop-a-follower-from-seeing-my-Instagram-posts"><a href="#3-How-do-I-stop-a-follower-from-seeing-my-Instagram-posts" class="headerlink" title="3.

Reels is a video feature that allows users to make 15-second multi-clip snaps. You can add various effects, set a time limit for the clip, set the speed, and most importantly, you can also add audio (similar to Instagram Music). It was first launched in Brazil as a trial run and is now available in about 50 countries worldwide. Reels have been extremely successful as people from other such apps, e.g., Tiktok, are attracted towards it. Content creators and brands use it for the promotion and marketing of their products. Moreover, in the lockdown, it has also proved to be a fun and exciting time pass.</p><p><strong>Instagram Stories</strong> - another product of Instagram is also a video-sharing platform. For some of you, you may be wondering which one should you upload your video to. We may be able to help you choose the right platform for you by providing their comparison in the following.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">How to use Instagram Reels?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">How to use Instagram Stories?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Differences between Instagram Reels and Stories</a></li></ul><h2 id="How-to-Use-Instagram-Reels-and-Instagram-Stories"><a href="#How-to-Use-Instagram-Reels-and-Instagram-Stories" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Instagram Reels and Instagram Stories"></a>How to Use Instagram Reels and Instagram Stories</h2><p>Many people get a little confused about making Reels and Stories, so here we will let you know the easiest way to make Instagram Reels and Instagram Stories.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137395/7443" target="_top" id="2137395">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137395" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137395/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-to-use-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#How-to-use-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="#How to use Instagram Reels?"></a>#How to use Instagram Reels?</h3><p>To make perfect and creative Instagram Reels, follow the below-mentioned process:</p><p>1. Swipe left or click on the camera button on the top left corner to open the camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/launch-instagram-app1.jpg"                      alt="launch instagram app"                ></p><p>2.

You will now have tools for editing your Reel on the left of your screen.</p><p>4. The four tools you can use are Audio, AR effects, Timer and Countdown, Align, and Speed. The <strong>Audio</strong> tool allows you to add any audio from the Instagram music library to your Reel. You can also use original audios, which will then be attributed to you, and your viewers can use that audio in their own Reels by selecting “Use Audio.” You can also choose different <strong>AR effects</strong> to enhance your Reels. The AR effects may be created by Instagram or its users. <strong>Timer and Countdown</strong> can be used to set a time limit for a single clip and set a countdown so that you can settle in before it starts recording. The <strong>Align</strong> feature smoothens the process of transitioning from one clip to another. Last but not least, you can also set the <strong>Speed</strong> of your Reel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-tab.jpg"                      alt="Instagram Reels Tab"                ></p><p>5. Use these tools to make a Reel as per your choice. Click on Next or Done.</p><p>6. You can add your caption and choose a cover for your Reel from the video or gallery on the Share page. You also have the option to Share to Feed. You can also save it as a draft if you don’t wish to upload it immediately. Otherwise, just click on “Share” to share it on the Explore page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-reels-on-instagram.jpg"                      alt="share reels on instagram"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105870/7443" target="_top" id="2105870">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105870" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105870/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-to-use-Instagram-Stories"><a href="#How-to-use-Instagram-Stories" class="headerlink" title="# How to use Instagram Stories?"></a># How to use Instagram Stories?</h3><p>Instagram Stories are a way for people to interact with their followers on a day-to-day basis.

You can then record a video or capture a photo. You can use various filters or add text and stickers to your Story, move and resize the text and stickers as per your need. You can also upload anything from your camera roll. To do that, simply swipe up after the camera opens.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-insta-stories-3.jpg"                      alt="posting a instagram story"                ></p><p>3. When you are done editing your Story, tap on “Your Story” to upload it. You also have the option to share it only with your “Close Friends” or DM it to someone by tapping on “Send to.”</p><p>4. You can view your own Story by tapping on your profile picture at the top of the Home page.</p><h2 id="Differences-between-Instagram-Reels-and-Stories"><a href="#Differences-between-Instagram-Reels-and-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Differences between Instagram Reels and Stories"></a>Differences between Instagram Reels and Stories</h2><p>Now let’s take a look at the difference between these two, Instagram Reels and Instagram Stories.</p><ul><li><strong>Time Availability:</strong> Instagram stories disappear after 24 hours unless they are saved in your highlights. While Instagram Reels stays in your Reels tab and feed.</li><li><strong>Length:</strong> For the Instagram stories, a video’s maximum length is 15 seconds, and for a picture, it is 7 seconds. For Instagram Reels, the maximum limit is 15 seconds too.</li><li><strong>Hashtags:</strong> Hashtags are used to gain more reach on everything you post. For the Instagram Stories, if you add a hashtag, the users must tap to see your Story. Since there are many stories, the chances of yours showing up are low. Plus, the Story disappears after 24 hours. For Instagram Reels, when a hashtag is searched, the Reels show up at the top due to the algorithm settings. This ensures maximum reach.</li><li><strong>Reach:</strong> Mostly, the people who view Instagram Stories are the followers of the account. In the case of Instagram Reels, people who do not follow can also view your Reels, increasing your reach.</li><li><strong>Saves:</strong> An Instagram Story of someone cannot be saved for you to view later. The Instagram Reels can be saved by the users.</li><li><strong>Explore Page:</strong> Instagram Stories rarely get featured on the explore page. On the other hand, Instagram Reels take the most space, ensuring they are watched the most.</li><li><strong>Editing tools:</strong> For the Stories, you can access filters, different layouts, and camera effects. While Instagram Reels gives access to more devices such as Audio editing, AR effects, Alignment of several clips and pictures, Timer, and Countdown, you can also control your actions’ speed.</li><li><strong>Sharing:</strong> Instagram Stories can be shared as a story or be sent to someone’s inbox, but they disappear 24 hours. Instagram Reels can be shared by almost anyone and do not disappear.</li></ul><h2 id="Is-My-Video-Suitable-of-Instagram-Reels-or-Stories"><a href="#Is-My-Video-Suitable-of-Instagram-Reels-or-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Is My Video Suitable of Instagram Reels or Stories?"></a>Is My Video Suitable of Instagram Reels or Stories?</h2><p>As discussed above in the section that focuses on using both the features, the type of content can be understood. Instagram Reels focuses more on content creation, while Instagram Stories focuses more on real-time events. A dance video is suitable for Instagram Reels, while a video made while traveling is suitable for an Instagram story. Sometimes an edited travel video can also be shared on Reels as content, while a rawer version is suitable for Instagram Stories.</p><p>So, in essence, anything that you want to reach to the world, anything that showcases your talents, is suitable for Instagram Reels. While anything you do as a recreational activity, whether it is dining out, reading a book, visiting a new place, or capturing a momentous occasion that is mostly personal, all these things is perfect and suitable for Instagram Stories.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135408/19272" target="_top" id="2135408">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135408" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135408/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Make-Your-Instagram-Reels-Video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Make-Your-Instagram-Reels-Video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Make Your Instagram Reels Video with Filmora"></a>Make Your Instagram Reels Video with <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>To increase your views on Instagram Reels, a well-edited video is a must-have.

Keep it Simple</h3><p>When Instagram introduces a new feature, it might seem like a massive wave is breaking over your Stories as businesses rush to be the ones to use it.</p><p>Don’t make your audience suffer from New Feature Syndrome! Questions (and all other additional features) should be used cautiously and wisely.

Don’t let your fans down; they are going to expect it from you.</p><p>Take some time off of your busy schedule to observe and respond to all of the queries that have been received. To estimate how many to expect, check your Instagram data, such as your average rate of Story responses.</p><p>You should be prepared to answer challenging inquiries or even unfavorable criticism based on your organization and community.

Here is another bonus section regarding tips on vertical videos for Instagram in addition to the video specs. Read through them as we have covered how to make vertical videos stunning for Instagram.</p><p><strong>Tip 1: Be specific to vertical</strong></p><p>Why get worked up by shooting the video in Landscape and cropping them? To make it a hassle-free task so that you can share the video on multiple platforms like Facebook and YouTube, you can turn your camera upright on your smartphone and shoot the vertical footage for the best results. Doing so will let you complete control over the screen to fill the whole frame for a better viewing experience. If on camera, you can rotate it to 90 degrees.</p><p><strong>Tip 2: Post-produce edit from horizontal to vertical</strong></p><p>Is the video already shot horizontally on your camera or smartphone? No worries, as you can edit them to the desired aspect ratio from 16:9 to 9:16 with the assistance of software like iMovie, Final Cut Pro X, and other third-party applications like <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Wondershare Filmora</strong></a>. This tactic’s only challenge is that you need to be ready to crop the left and right sides of the shot or recorded video, and do not forget that the concept needs to be centralized!</p><p><strong>Tip 3: Crop to reveal details</strong></p><p>Vertical video is a great option to showcase wide and tall subjects where you can place close-ups and show off details to get up close and personal. It could be a product or fabric. You can showcase enticing minor elements that attract an audience in such landscape shots.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123740/7443" target="_top" id="2123740">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123740" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123740/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Hence, I am sure you found new tactics to create vertical videos for Instagram.

The action looks so slow that you think everything has stopped moving but in reality, it hasn’t – just slower than our eyes can normally perceive.</p><p>Slow-motion video is popular on Instagram Reels as well. In this article, we will show you how to</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Slow Motion?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">How To Record Only Part Of A Video In Slow Motion On Reels?</a></p><p>05 <a href="#part5">How to Convert Normal Speed Video to Slow Motion For Reels?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Slow-Motion"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Slow-Motion" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Slow Motion?"></a>Part 1: What is Slow Motion?</h2><p>Slow-motion can be achieved by either dropping frames from a video sequence, or simply playing the existing frames in slow succession. It lets you capture some fun clips by turning everyday things into something special. For example, water droplets falling and causing different effects as they splatter and spread can be really fascinating to see, just like paint dropping onto a giant canvas.</p><p>That’s why it is very important to use high-resolution recording when shooting such video to prevent the stuttering effect. The higher the frame rate, the more we can slow down the action without noticeable jarring because each frame will be captured in more detail.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a new feature within the Instagram app where users can create short 15-second videos and add them to their Instagram Stories. The new tool plays with time and motion in a creative way by letting you record clips but only keeps the last 15 seconds. While this might seem to limit at first, it actually opens up some creative possibilities for creating interesting vignettes. But how does the Instagram reels slow motion function work?</p><p>The secret behind Instagram reels slow-motion lies in its audio features. When recording a video, regardless of whether it’s in normal or slow-motion mode, you’ll be able to select songs from any music library that’s available on your device, add sound effects, and add voiceovers. Instagram takes advantage of this by speeding up the audio to a normal speed when you’re recording in slow motion and then slowing it down just enough so that it sounds natural when you playback the video at 1x speed. This means that your Reels videos will have a consistent volume even if you choose a song from a playlist with differing volumes.</p><p>This gives Reels users an interesting option: they can use songs from playlists where each track varies in terms of volume, thus creating some sort of visual story-telling through their 15-second clips.</p><p>But that’s not all; once you’ve recorded your video, you can add filters and editing tools to give it even more life.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a feature that lets users create short videos consisting of multiple photos or clips placed together in order of their choice. The reels can be created from posts made by the user as well as from the user’s camera roll containing photos and videos taken before. These can even be edited further to add some filters or text to them. Once you are done creating a reel, you can share it on your Instagram story for friends and followers to see.</p><p>To understand how to make slow-motion video on Instagram reels, follow these steps:</p><p>First, launch the Instagram app and swipe right to reach the camera page. Alternatively, you could tap the Story button in the top left corner.</p><p>Now tap ‘Reels’ in the bottom panel beside ‘Story.’ You can select the time from here. The maximum time allowed is 60 sec for a reel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-recording-time-option.jpg"                      alt="instagram reels recording time option"                ></p><p>When recording a slow-motion video on Reels, you need to set the speed before you record the video. To do so, tap the ‘Speed’ button below your selected photo or clip-on Reels and select either 0.3x or 0.5x from the two options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-recording-speed-option.jpg"                      alt="instagram reels recording speed option"                ></p><p>Tap the camera button beside the ‘Speed’ button to take a test shot and see if you are satisfied with the speed.

It lets you capture some fun clips by turning everyday things into something special. For example, water droplets falling and causing different effects as they splatter and spread can be really fascinating to see, just like paint dropping onto a giant canvas.</p><p>That’s why it is very important to use high-resolution recording when shooting such video to prevent the stuttering effect. The higher the frame rate, the more we can slow down the action without noticeable jarring because each frame will be captured in more detail.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a new feature within the Instagram app where users can create short 15-second videos and add them to their Instagram Stories. The new tool plays with time and motion in a creative way by letting you record clips but only keeps the last 15 seconds. While this might seem to limit at first, it actually opens up some creative possibilities for creating interesting vignettes. But how does the Instagram reels slow motion function work?</p><p>The secret behind Instagram reels slow-motion lies in its audio features. When recording a video, regardless of whether it’s in normal or slow-motion mode, you’ll be able to select songs from any music library that’s available on your device, add sound effects, and add voiceovers. Instagram takes advantage of this by speeding up the audio to a normal speed when you’re recording in slow motion and then slowing it down just enough so that it sounds natural when you playback the video at 1x speed. This means that your Reels videos will have a consistent volume even if you choose a song from a playlist with differing volumes.</p><p>This gives Reels users an interesting option: they can use songs from playlists where each track varies in terms of volume, thus creating some sort of visual story-telling through their 15-second clips.</p><p>But that’s not all; once you’ve recorded your video, you can add filters and editing tools to give it even more life.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a feature that lets users create short videos consisting of multiple photos or clips placed together in order of their choice. The reels can be created from posts made by the user as well as from the user’s camera roll containing photos and videos taken before. These can even be edited further to add some filters or text to them. Once you are done creating a reel, you can share it on your Instagram story for friends and followers to see.</p><p>To understand how to make slow-motion video on Instagram reels, follow these steps:</p><p>First, launch the Instagram app and swipe right to reach the camera page.
