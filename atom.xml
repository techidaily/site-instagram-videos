Today Instagram stories have become more popular than the OG Snapchat. Instagram stories are a great feature to share your journey with your followers. However, the stories are temporary and only last for 24 hours. You can view the stories of your followers in your feed but you can also check the stories of people you are not following on the discover feed. The person who posted the story can see who has seen the story through Instagram story viewer.</p><p>To find out more about IG story viewer and how it works, continue reading this article.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">1.

How Does Instagram Organize the Story Views?"></a>1. How Does Instagram Organize the Story Views?</h2><p>Over just a decade ago, Instagram has grown to become one of the most popular social media platforms with over 1 billion active users worldwide. Instagram is constantly evolving and introducing intriguing updates, intuitive design, and crazy monetization features. What started as a picture editing and sharing app, has now become a crazy online business tool. Celebrities, influencers, entrepreneurs and multi-billion corporations are all using Instagram to directly engage with their target audience and get new customers.</p><p>With millions of people using the app every day, Instagram has to constantly upgrade its algorithm to maintain transparency – so, cheats, no shortcuts, and no hacks! Instagram algorithms are based on engagement, hashtags, shout-outs, and other factors. However, engagement elements like comments, likes, saves, and views determine most content that will appear on the feed.</p><p>Instagram uses the same algorithm to organize the story feeds as well. Thus, how you engage and connect with your followers and audience will determine, how Instagram organizes the placement of your story and your story views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-instagram-story-viewer.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925565/19272" target="_top" id="1925565">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925565" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925565/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="2-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-List"><a href="#2-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-List" class="headerlink" title="2. The Instagram Story Viewer List?"></a>2. The Instagram Story Viewer List?</h2><p>Instagram has two feeds, a vertical feed, and a horizontal feed. The vertical feed shows shared posts like an image, boomerang or reel. And, the vertical feed at the top of the page is the story feed. The story feed presents the micro user content. These are 15-second-long videos that appear for instant interaction with the followers. Instagram uses advanced algorithms to organize the feed and views.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-instagram-story-viewer-list.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer-list"                ></p><p>Each story that people see generates views. These views are arranged in a story viewer list. Instagram story viewers list is the one that contains all your story views. To access this list:</p><ul><li>Open your Instagram app and tap on your profile picture at the top of your feed</li><li>If you have put up story there, look at the lower-left corner of the picture&#x2F;boomerang&#x2F;video</li><li>Here the people who viewed your stories will appear under the tag “Seen by #” (The “Seen by #” label will show how who and how many of among your followers have seen your story)</li><li>Tap on Seen by # to open the story viewers list</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902289/19272" target="_top" id="1902289">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902289" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902289/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-What’s-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-Order"><a href="#3-What’s-The-Instagram-Story-Viewer-Order" class="headerlink" title="3. What’s The Instagram Story Viewer Order?"></a>3. What’s The Instagram Story Viewer Order?</h2><p>Previously Instagram story views were arranged in chronological order. However, in 2021 the story views are organized based on engagement. The new Instagram algorithm shows the accounts you engage with the most at the top of your story views list.</p><p>Similarly, the more engagement you have with the follower the more chances are of that follower to be at the top of the views list. These accounts are those that give you the most likes, comments, DMs, profile visits, saves etc. But this algorithm only works for those who get more than 50 views. If your story gets under 50 views then the list is sequential meaning that the one who watches your stories first will show up at the top of the list.</p><h2 id="4-How-Does-Instagram-Sorts-Instagram-Story-Viewers"><a href="#4-How-Does-Instagram-Sorts-Instagram-Story-Viewers" class="headerlink" title="4. How Does Instagram Sorts Instagram Story Viewers?"></a>4. How Does Instagram Sorts Instagram Story Viewers?</h2><p>Instagram sorts story views through an algorithm that is based on total profile visits, comments, likes and other interactive elements. Based on the data from these factors, Instagram ranks the reviewers of a story. As stated earlier the accounts users interact with the most will appear first in their story feed.</p><p>So, the key is to make your followers engage and interact with you. A lot of people have tried to crack the algorithm, but Instagram has kept it a secret so no one can manipulate it. This maintains transparency and tough competition among users. A useful tip is to use location sticker on story because viewers also view stories by location so using location hashtag in story can also prove to be effective.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-instagram-story-viewer-algorithm.jpg"                      alt="instagram-story-viewer-algorithm"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047411/19272" target="_top" id="2047411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047411/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Is-It-Anonymous-When-Viewing-One’s-Instagram-Story"><a href="#5-Is-It-Anonymous-When-Viewing-One’s-Instagram-Story" class="headerlink" title="5.

Is It Anonymous When Viewing One’s Instagram Story?</h2><p>In simple words no you cannot view your following’s Instagram stories anonymously from the Instagram app. Whichever account you use to view the story it will appear in in the story viewers list of the person who posted the story. A lot of people do use third-party apps to anonymously access Instagram stories. Other also create fake accounts to conceal their real identity.</p><h2 id="6-How-Can-I-Know-If-Someone-Viewed-My-Instagram-Stories"><a href="#6-How-Can-I-Know-If-Someone-Viewed-My-Instagram-Stories" class="headerlink" title="6.

To know if someone has viewed your Instagram story simply tap on your profile picture in the story feed and open the story you shared. Now follow these steps:</p><ul><li>At the bottom left corner of the screen, you will see “Seen by [number of views&#x2F;people who have seen the story]”</li><li>Tap on this “Seen by #” option to open your story viewers</li><li>This list contains all the people who have seen your story and tells you how many people have viewed your Instagram story</li></ul><p>A lot of people also use tools to view Instagram stories anonymously so for that you might need an Instagram story viewer app.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1883998/19272" target="_top" id="1883998">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1883998" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1883998/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Pay-Attention-to-The-Instagram-Stories-Algorithm-Change"><a href="#Pay-Attention-to-The-Instagram-Stories-Algorithm-Change" class="headerlink" title="Pay Attention to The Instagram Stories Algorithm Change"></a>Pay Attention to The Instagram Stories Algorithm Change</h3><p>When it comes to digital platforms algorithms are the tools that determine who should see which content.

But, you can be doubtful about posting them on Instagram because they look raw. Some people think they can only apply filters when taking photos directly from Instagram. However, this is not the case because you can apply an Instagram filter to existing images also. It not only makes the picture appear more attractive but also catches the audience’s attention. In this section, you will learn how to apply an Instagram filter to any photo from your gallery.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Open Instagram and swipe left</strong></p><p>To add Instagram filters, you have to open Instagram and log in to your existing ID. When you are on your news feed, you have to <strong>swipe left</strong> to open the stories option. When you swipe left, your camera will open automatically. Another way to open the stories option is to <strong>tap on the ‘+’ sign</strong> on your profile picture.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tap-plus-icon-instagram.jpg"                      alt="enter Instgram camera"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Select an image from the gallery</strong></p><p>After you open the stories option, the camera will open first.

The latest buzz on Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook are the hilarious gender swap pictures that let you see how you would look like if you were a man or a woman. However, at the moment there are only a few apps that offer gender swap effects, so you must either use Snapchat or the FaceApp to swap genders. That is why in this article we are going to show you a few different methods of creating gender swap photos with these two apps.</p><h2 id="Swapping-Gender-with-Snapchat-Filters"><a href="#Swapping-Gender-with-Snapchat-Filters" class="headerlink" title="Swapping Gender with Snapchat Filters"></a>Swapping Gender with Snapchat Filters</h2><p>Snapchat introduced three new filters that caught the attention of the crowd on social media because they highlight masculine or feminine characteristics of facial traits. The ‘man lens’ will make your jawline shaper, hair shorter and your beard longer, while the ‘woman lens’ makes your skin look softer or applies some makeup to your face. The ‘baby lens’ however, is by far the most popular of the three because it enables people to see how they would look like if they were less than six months old.</p><p>Taking a photo of yourself while any of these filters is enabled is a simple process that won’t take more than a few seconds. Launch the Snapchat app, then open the camera and switch to the phone’s front camera by tapping on the arrow icon at the top of the screen. Each of the gender swap filters should be within the top ten filters in the Snapchat’s filter collection, so just select the one you like and then take a photo. After you Tap on the Save button, the picture you’ve taken is going to be stored in the Snapchat memories.</p><h2 id="Post-Images-Taken-with-the-Gender-Swap-Snapchat-Lens-to-Instagram-or-Facebook"><a href="#Post-Images-Taken-with-the-Gender-Swap-Snapchat-Lens-to-Instagram-or-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Post Images Taken with the Gender Swap Snapchat Lens to Instagram or Facebook"></a>Post Images Taken with the Gender Swap Snapchat Lens to Instagram or Facebook</h2><p>At the moment Instagram and Facebook don’t offer gender swap filters to its users, and if you want to post a gender swap photo on these two social media you have to take a photo with another app. Sharing a picture you’ve taken with Snapchat on Facebook, Instagram or other social media is not complicated although it requires some time and effort. Once you’ve taken the photo with the man, women or baby lens you should tap on the icon that looks like two cards that is located at the bottom of the screen and select the gender swap picture you want to share on Instagram or Facebook. Take the screenshot of the photo you selected, and save it to your phone’s Camera Roll.</p><p>Launch the Instagram app and use its photo editing tools to crop out all unwanted parts of the picture or enhance its colors. You are not going to be able to edit your gender swap photo with the Facebook app, even though you can easily share the photo on your profile. Sadly there is no indication that either Facebook or Instagram are going to introduce new gender swap filters in the near future and Snapchat is still one of your best options if you want to create this type of photos.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130529/26400" target="_top" id="2130529">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130529" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130529/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Install-FaceApp-to-Your-iPhone-or-Android-Device"><a href="#Install-FaceApp-to-Your-iPhone-or-Android-Device" class="headerlink" title="Install FaceApp to Your iPhone or Android Device"></a>Install FaceApp to Your iPhone or Android Device</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/faceapp-change-gender.jpg"                      alt="Change Gender with FaceApp "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111994/7443" target="_top" id="2111994">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111994" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111994/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/faceapp-ai-face-editor/id1180884341?mt=8" >FaceApp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a strong alternative to the newly added gender swap effects on Snapchat because it offers more gender swap filters and it makes sharing the images on Facebook or Instagram much easier. The app can be downloaded for free from the AppStore or <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.faceapp&hl=en" >GooglePlay Store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, but you must make in-app purchases if you want to unlock its Pro features. However, even the free version of the app utilizes Artificial Intelligence and neural nets to analyze a vast amount of images and use the findings to make your face look more masculine or more feminine.</p><p>The app’s users can either take new photos or edit the pictures they’ve taken with another app, but some filters are only available if you purchase a monthly or an annual subscription. The FaceApp lets you put on a new smile, swap genders or use the cool style filters to take better selfies. You can experiment with different looks and see how you’d look like if you were a Hollywood superstar or if you had a long blonde hair. Once you find the look that all of your friends must see, you can share the gender swap photo to Instagram or Facebook with a single tap.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Screenshot on Snapchat without Them Knowing &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Taking a swap gender photo is going to cheer up your day and give your friends on social media a good laugh.

Enjoy!</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Free online solutions</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Browser add-ons</a></li><li><a href="#part1">Part 3: App solutions for your smartphone</a></li></ul><h3 id="Part-1-Instagram-Photo-Video-Downloader-Free-online-solutions"><a href="#Part-1-Instagram-Photo-Video-Downloader-Free-online-solutions" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Instagram Photo&#x2F;Video Downloader - Free online solutions"></a>Part 1: Instagram Photo&#x2F;Video Downloader - Free online solutions</h3><h4 id="1-iGram"><a href="#1-iGram" class="headerlink" title="1. iGram:"></a>1. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://igram.io/" >iGram: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>This web-based Instagram picture downloader can grab all the images associated with a single post. To use it, simply copy the link from your browsers URL bar and paste into the box on the website. Click ‘Download’ and the web app will snatch all the content you want. It’s one of the simplest and easiest Instagram photo downloader tools out there but will only function with public Instagram posts.</p><h4 id="2-Dredown"><a href="#2-Dredown" class="headerlink" title="2. Dredown:"></a>2. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.dredown.com/" >Dredown: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>Sometimes referred to by its original name of Instadown, this was one of the first Instagram video downloader online apps. As with iGram, simply paste the URL of the desired video into the search bar and click the ‘Dredown’ button. The software will instantly begin to download the MP4 file for you to save on your device. This Instagram video downloader works with all other networks too, including Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo and Vine.</p><h4 id="3-blastup"><a href="#3-blastup" class="headerlink" title="3. blastup:"></a>3. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://blastup.com/instagram-downloader" >blastup: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>As with the other web apps, blastup functions by inputting the URL into the search box and requesting a download. It works as both an Instagram image downloader and for video too, so it’s a great tool to have in your arsenal.</p><h4 id="4-InstaFinsta"><a href="#4-InstaFinsta" class="headerlink" title="4. InstaFinsta:"></a>4. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://instafinsta.com/" >InstaFinsta: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>Again, a simple copy and paste downloader, free to use in any web browser. This one works with TikTok too, and the slick user interface makes it one of our favorites. You can also drag and drop a widget into your browser toolbar to save the software as a bookmark, then once in Instagram, simply click the bookmark to download the image instantly.</p><h4 id="5-Inflact"><a href="#5-Inflact" class="headerlink" title="5. Inflact:"></a>5. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://inflact.com/downloader/instagram/video/" >Inflact: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>We love this website as it’s not only a downloader but also an Instagram video converter. Maybe you don’t want your video in MP4; perhaps you need it in AVI, 3GP or WMV? It’s all possible with Inflact as this clever Instagram video converter will grab your URL and download it in any format you desire.</p><p>Although these Instagram image downloader services all do roughly the same thing, it’s worth keeping more than one in mind. If a web app has been cited as being involved in a copyright infringement situation, they could be taken offline for days or even weeks, so have a sound back up plan just in case.</p><h3 id="Part-2-Instagram-Photo-Video-Downloader-Browser-add-ons"><a href="#Part-2-Instagram-Photo-Video-Downloader-Browser-add-ons" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Instagram Photo&#x2F;Video Downloader - Browser add-ons"></a>Part 2: Instagram Photo&#x2F;Video Downloader - Browser add-ons</h3><p>Sometimes all that copying and pasting can be somewhat tiring, so for the uber lazy, some nice developers have released browser add-ons that work as Instagram photo downloader tools.

It’s free, but right now it doesn’t allow video uploads from your PC, although the developers say they are working on that.</p><h4 id="3-Instagram-Video-Download"><a href="#3-Instagram-Video-Download" class="headerlink" title="3.

To use it, simply copy the link from your browsers URL bar and paste into the box on the website. Click ‘Download’ and the web app will snatch all the content you want. It’s one of the simplest and easiest Instagram photo downloader tools out there but will only function with public Instagram posts.</p><h4 id="2-Dredown-3"><a href="#2-Dredown-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Dredown:"></a>2. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.dredown.com/" >Dredown: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>Sometimes referred to by its original name of Instadown, this was one of the first Instagram video downloader online apps. As with iGram, simply paste the URL of the desired video into the search bar and click the ‘Dredown’ button. The software will instantly begin to download the MP4 file for you to save on your device. This Instagram video downloader works with all other networks too, including Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo and Vine.</p><h4 id="3-blastup-3"><a href="#3-blastup-3" class="headerlink" title="3. blastup:"></a>3. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://blastup.com/instagram-downloader" >blastup: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>As with the other web apps, blastup functions by inputting the URL into the search box and requesting a download. It works as both an Instagram image downloader and for video too, so it’s a great tool to have in your arsenal.</p><h4 id="4-InstaFinsta-3"><a href="#4-InstaFinsta-3" class="headerlink" title="4. InstaFinsta:"></a>4. <strong><a class="link"   href="https://instafinsta.com/" >InstaFinsta: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></h4><p>Again, a simple copy and paste downloader, free to use in any web browser. This one works with TikTok too, and the slick user interface makes it one of our favorites. You can also drag and drop a widget into your browser toolbar to save the software as a bookmark, then once in Instagram, simply click the bookmark to download the image instantly.</p><h4 id="5-Inflact-3"><a href="#5-Inflact-3" class="headerlink" title="5.

Maybe you don’t want your video in MP4; perhaps you need it in AVI, 3GP or WMV? It’s all possible with Inflact as this clever Instagram video converter will grab your URL and download it in any format you desire.</p><p>Although these Instagram image downloader services all do roughly the same thing, it’s worth keeping more than one in mind. If a web app has been cited as being involved in a copyright infringement situation, they could be taken offline for days or even weeks, so have a sound back up plan just in case.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148637/16836" target="_top" id="2148637">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148637" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148637/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Part-2-Instagram-Photo-Video-Downloader-Browser-add-ons-3"><a href="#Part-2-Instagram-Photo-Video-Downloader-Browser-add-ons-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Instagram Photo&#x2F;Video Downloader - Browser add-ons"></a>Part 2: Instagram Photo&#x2F;Video Downloader - Browser add-ons</h3><p>Sometimes all that copying and pasting can be somewhat tiring, so for the uber lazy, some nice developers have released browser add-ons that work as Instagram photo downloader tools.

So, while marketing a product on Instagram, you must know and understand the culture followed at Instagram.</p><p>For instance, when the brand <a class="link"   href="https://www.daytranslations.com/blog/how-pepsi-expands/" >Pepsi selected China to expand <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the launch slogan was “Pepsi Brings You Back to Life” which was misinterpreted by the people as “Pepsi Brings Your Ancestors Back from the Grave”. This was a huge mistake for the brand when it was trying to make a mark on the global level.</p><p>So, prior to planning strategies for Instagram video marketing, you must be aware of the type of promotions and marketing you should plan so that you never go wrong with your strategies. You must know the audience and understand their choices, likes, and what can drive them to your video.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Plan-Your-Instagram-Video-Marketing"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Plan-Your-Instagram-Video-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Plan Your Instagram Video Marketing"></a>Part 2: How to Plan Your Instagram Video Marketing</h2><h3 id="Step-1-Know-Your-Objective"><a href="#Step-1-Know-Your-Objective" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Know Your Objective"></a>Step 1: Know Your Objective</h3><p>To ensure a successful Instagram video marketing strategy, it is important that your videos are not just moving pieces without any message to convey.

The product can be in a number of colors or have a lot of features. But, that doesn’t mean you have to include it all in a 60-second video. Only add a few features and make the objective of the video clear for the audience to feel connected.</p><p>You may also create several short videos to make the audience understand it easily instead of one long video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/short-video.JPG"                      alt="Instagram Video Marketing short video"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1186802/12108" target="_top" id="1186802">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1186802" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/1186802/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-3-Make-High-Quality-Video"><a href="#Step-3-Make-High-Quality-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Make High-Quality Video"></a>Step 3: Make High-Quality Video</h3><p>You must never compromise on the quality of the video when it comes to <a class="link"   href="https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2018/05/04/instagram-videos" >how to make Instagram video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

If you are apprehensive about creating a video, you may just pick a few images and get your way through PowerPoint and make a slideshow.</p><p>The slideshows help in creating list, countdowns, steps, or to show transformation or progress.

It can be one of the best Instagram video ideas amongst all.</p><h3 id="7-Q-A-Video"><a href="#7-Q-A-Video" class="headerlink" title="7. Q&amp;A Video"></a>7.

Soon later, in the summer of 2019, Instagram added a new feature: you may now video chat with one or more of your friends in direct messaging without having to leave Instagram. This innovation will help Instagram to retain its users on the platform for longer than before, obviating the need for third-party programs such as Skype and Facetime.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is The Most Important Information You Should Know About Instagram?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How To Use Instagram Video Chat?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Things You Should Pay Attention To While Using Youtube Video Chat</a></p><h2 id="What-Is-The-Most-Important-Information-You-Should-Know-About-Instagram"><a href="#What-Is-The-Most-Important-Information-You-Should-Know-About-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="What Is The Most Important Information You Should Know About Instagram?"></a>What Is The Most Important Information You Should Know About Instagram?</h2><p>Instagram is a photo and video-sharing social networking platform with a smartphone app. You may create, modify, and share visual content so that your followers can interact with it through likes, comments</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/instagram-video-chat-1.jpg"                      alt="instgram video chat"                ></p><h4 id="When-Is-It-Introduced"><a href="#When-Is-It-Introduced" class="headerlink" title="When Is It Introduced?"></a>When Is It Introduced?</h4><p>Instagram is the most popular social networking platform in the world.

The action looks so slow that you think everything has stopped moving but in reality, it hasn’t – just slower than our eyes can normally perceive.</p><p>Slow-motion video is popular on Instagram Reels as well. In this article, we will show you how to</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Slow Motion?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">How To Record Only Part Of A Video In Slow Motion On Reels?</a></p><p>05 <a href="#part5">How to Convert Normal Speed Video to Slow Motion For Reels?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Slow-Motion"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Slow-Motion" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Slow Motion?"></a>Part 1: What is Slow Motion?</h2><p>Slow-motion can be achieved by either dropping frames from a video sequence, or simply playing the existing frames in slow succession. It lets you capture some fun clips by turning everyday things into something special. For example, water droplets falling and causing different effects as they splatter and spread can be really fascinating to see, just like paint dropping onto a giant canvas.</p><p>That’s why it is very important to use high-resolution recording when shooting such video to prevent the stuttering effect. The higher the frame rate, the more we can slow down the action without noticeable jarring because each frame will be captured in more detail.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a new feature within the Instagram app where users can create short 15-second videos and add them to their Instagram Stories. The new tool plays with time and motion in a creative way by letting you record clips but only keeps the last 15 seconds. While this might seem to limit at first, it actually opens up some creative possibilities for creating interesting vignettes. But how does the Instagram reels slow motion function work?</p><p>The secret behind Instagram reels slow-motion lies in its audio features. When recording a video, regardless of whether it’s in normal or slow-motion mode, you’ll be able to select songs from any music library that’s available on your device, add sound effects, and add voiceovers. Instagram takes advantage of this by speeding up the audio to a normal speed when you’re recording in slow motion and then slowing it down just enough so that it sounds natural when you playback the video at 1x speed. This means that your Reels videos will have a consistent volume even if you choose a song from a playlist with differing volumes.</p><p>This gives Reels users an interesting option: they can use songs from playlists where each track varies in terms of volume, thus creating some sort of visual story-telling through their 15-second clips.</p><p>But that’s not all; once you’ve recorded your video, you can add filters and editing tools to give it even more life.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a feature that lets users create short videos consisting of multiple photos or clips placed together in order of their choice. The reels can be created from posts made by the user as well as from the user’s camera roll containing photos and videos taken before. These can even be edited further to add some filters or text to them. Once you are done creating a reel, you can share it on your Instagram story for friends and followers to see.</p><p>To understand how to make slow-motion video on Instagram reels, follow these steps:</p><p>First, launch the Instagram app and swipe right to reach the camera page. Alternatively, you could tap the Story button in the top left corner.</p><p>Now tap ‘Reels’ in the bottom panel beside ‘Story.’ You can select the time from here. The maximum time allowed is 60 sec for a reel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-recording-time-option.jpg"                      alt="instagram reels recording time option"                ></p><p>When recording a slow-motion video on Reels, you need to set the speed before you record the video. To do so, tap the ‘Speed’ button below your selected photo or clip-on Reels and select either 0.3x or 0.5x from the two options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-recording-speed-option.jpg"                      alt="instagram reels recording speed option"                ></p><p>Tap the camera button beside the ‘Speed’ button to take a test shot and see if you are satisfied with the speed. If not, either change it or tap the x on top to cancel this particular video. Once you are happy with your speed, tap on the red record button next to it to start recording your slow-motion video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-instagram-reels-video-slow-motion.jpg"                      alt="record instagram reels video slow motion"                ></p><p>While playing back your slow-motion video, swipe left or right on the screen to play at normal speed as well as 0.3x and 0.5x speeds, respectively, for comparison purposes. Keep swiping left and right until you find the perfect playback speed for your clip. You can also pinch inwards or outwards while watching a slow-motion video to adjust what you see in its frame at a particular time.</p><p>To stop recording, click on the red button. You can see a preview by clicking on the Preview button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-instagram-reels-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="preview instagram reels slow motion video"                ></p><p>If you are okay with the video, click Next. Now, share it with reels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-instagram-reels-slow-motion-video.jpg"                      alt="share instagram reels slow motion video"                ></p><p>Since the playback speed is not the only factor responsible for making videos look really slow-motion, it is equally important to ensure that your shots have an ample amount of action and motion in them. This way, when you choose to play them back at regular speeds or slower ones, their contents will be discernible enough to make a lasting impression on your audience. Depending on the kind of video you want to shoot, simply increase or decrease the number of clips that you use as well as their duration.</p><p>So, what more should you cater to understand how to make slow motion reels on Instagram?</p><p>When editing videos using Reels, make sure they don’t consist of too many unrelated photographs and videos. Try to make a video containing a single concept if possible; otherwise, it will be difficult for your audience to follow. Also, you can add effects or filters before publishing them on the platform, based on which they will look more impressive. In addition to this, you can also create longer slideshows of multiple reels by simply playing them one after the other either in the same order as that in which they were stacked together or by shuffling their order.</p><p>Play around with these settings and see what works best for you.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Record-Only-Part-Of-A-Video-In-Slow-Motion-On-Reels"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Record-Only-Part-Of-A-Video-In-Slow-Motion-On-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How To Record Only Part Of A Video In Slow Motion On Reels?"></a>Part 4: How To Record Only Part Of A Video In Slow Motion On Reels?</h2><p>On Instagram, you can record a video in slow motion. You can even go further and record only a portion of your video in slow motion while the rest plays at an average speed rate. This gives an interesting effect to your videos where you’d want some parts to be played at normal speed and others played in slow motion.</p><ul><li>In this way, you can create exciting reels that will make people notice what they are all about! To do this, Go to the Instagram camera or Story page, and select Reels option.</li><li>You’ll have the choice to speed up or slow down various portions of the video or audio by selecting the speed as in the previous section. For instance, if you want the first 20 seconds of video to be a slow motion at the speed of 0.3x, then select as shown below.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-part-of-instagram-reels-slow-motion-recording.jpg"                      alt="start part of instagram reels slow motion recording"                ></p><ul><li>And record the video till 40 seconds are left and stop. Now select speed 1x for the rest of the video to record a complete video.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-instagram-reels-part-slow-motion.jpg"                      alt="record instagram reels part slow motion"                ></p><ul><li>This video will be in slow motion for the first 20 seconds, and the rest of the video will play at normal speed. You can see the white line in the image below depicting slow motion before the line and normal motion after the line. You can see the preview by clicking “Preview.” If you are happy with the creation, you can share it.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-normal-speed-video-instagram-reels.jpg"                      alt="record normal speed video instagram reels"                ></p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Convert-Normal-Speed-Video-to-Slow-Motion-For-Reels"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Convert-Normal-Speed-Video-to-Slow-Motion-For-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Convert Normal Speed Video to Slow Motion For Reels?"></a>Part 5: How to Convert Normal Speed Video to Slow Motion For Reels?</h2><p>If you have recorded a video with normal speed and now want to turn it into slow motion for sharing on Instagram Reels, you will need to convert normal speed video to slow motion.

It lets you capture some fun clips by turning everyday things into something special. For example, water droplets falling and causing different effects as they splatter and spread can be really fascinating to see, just like paint dropping onto a giant canvas.</p><p>That’s why it is very important to use high-resolution recording when shooting such video to prevent the stuttering effect. The higher the frame rate, the more we can slow down the action without noticeable jarring because each frame will be captured in more detail.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a new feature within the Instagram app where users can create short 15-second videos and add them to their Instagram Stories. The new tool plays with time and motion in a creative way by letting you record clips but only keeps the last 15 seconds. While this might seem to limit at first, it actually opens up some creative possibilities for creating interesting vignettes. But how does the Instagram reels slow motion function work?</p><p>The secret behind Instagram reels slow-motion lies in its audio features. When recording a video, regardless of whether it’s in normal or slow-motion mode, you’ll be able to select songs from any music library that’s available on your device, add sound effects, and add voiceovers. Instagram takes advantage of this by speeding up the audio to a normal speed when you’re recording in slow motion and then slowing it down just enough so that it sounds natural when you playback the video at 1x speed. This means that your Reels videos will have a consistent volume even if you choose a song from a playlist with differing volumes.</p><p>This gives Reels users an interesting option: they can use songs from playlists where each track varies in terms of volume, thus creating some sort of visual story-telling through their 15-second clips.</p><p>But that’s not all; once you’ve recorded your video, you can add filters and editing tools to give it even more life.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels-2"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a feature that lets users create short videos consisting of multiple photos or clips placed together in order of their choice.

It lets you capture some fun clips by turning everyday things into something special. For example, water droplets falling and causing different effects as they splatter and spread can be really fascinating to see, just like paint dropping onto a giant canvas.</p><p>That’s why it is very important to use high-resolution recording when shooting such video to prevent the stuttering effect. The higher the frame rate, the more we can slow down the action without noticeable jarring because each frame will be captured in more detail.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Slow-Motion-Work-On-Instagram-Reels-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 2: How Does Slow Motion Work On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a new feature within the Instagram app where users can create short 15-second videos and add them to their Instagram Stories. The new tool plays with time and motion in a creative way by letting you record clips but only keeps the last 15 seconds. While this might seem to limit at first, it actually opens up some creative possibilities for creating interesting vignettes. But how does the Instagram reels slow motion function work?</p><p>The secret behind Instagram reels slow-motion lies in its audio features. When recording a video, regardless of whether it’s in normal or slow-motion mode, you’ll be able to select songs from any music library that’s available on your device, add sound effects, and add voiceovers. Instagram takes advantage of this by speeding up the audio to a normal speed when you’re recording in slow motion and then slowing it down just enough so that it sounds natural when you playback the video at 1x speed. This means that your Reels videos will have a consistent volume even if you choose a song from a playlist with differing volumes.</p><p>This gives Reels users an interesting option: they can use songs from playlists where each track varies in terms of volume, thus creating some sort of visual story-telling through their 15-second clips.</p><p>But that’s not all; once you’ve recorded your video, you can add filters and editing tools to give it even more life.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959712/19272" target="_top" id="1959712">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959712" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959712/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Make-Slow-Motion-Video-On-Instagram-Reels-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?"></a>Part 3: How To Make Slow Motion Video On Instagram Reels?</h2><p>Instagram Reels is a feature that lets users create short videos consisting of multiple photos or clips placed together in order of their choice. The reels can be created from posts made by the user as well as from the user’s camera roll containing photos and videos taken before. These can even be edited further to add some filters or text to them. Once you are done creating a reel, you can share it on your Instagram story for friends and followers to see.</p><p>To understand how to make slow-motion video on Instagram reels, follow these steps:</p><p>First, launch the Instagram app and swipe right to reach the camera page.

Depending on the kind of video you want to shoot, simply increase or decrease the number of clips that you use as well as their duration.</p><p>So, what more should you cater to understand how to make slow motion reels on Instagram?</p><p>When editing videos using Reels, make sure they don’t consist of too many unrelated photographs and videos. Try to make a video containing a single concept if possible; otherwise, it will be difficult for your audience to follow. Also, you can add effects or filters before publishing them on the platform, based on which they will look more impressive. In addition to this, you can also create longer slideshows of multiple reels by simply playing them one after the other either in the same order as that in which they were stacked together or by shuffling their order.</p><p>Play around with these settings and see what works best for you.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Record-Only-Part-Of-A-Video-In-Slow-Motion-On-Reels-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Record-Only-Part-Of-A-Video-In-Slow-Motion-On-Reels-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How To Record Only Part Of A Video In Slow Motion On Reels?"></a>Part 4: How To Record Only Part Of A Video In Slow Motion On Reels?</h2><p>On Instagram, you can record a video in slow motion.
