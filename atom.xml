A watermark can easily ruin that balance without a good reason since it will hardly prevent someone who decided to steal your work from actually doing it.</p><p><strong>Watermarks are easily removed:</strong> Don’t think for a second that anyone with only a basic level of Photoshop skills, can’t crop or clone stamp a watermark from a photo. Unless you intend to place a watermark over an entire image, like stock photography websites do, but even then removing a watermark is far from impossible.</p><p><strong>You won’t look like a pro:</strong> A watermark will not make you look more professional than you already are, the quality of your photos will. Although photographers sign their prints all the time, a watermark can make you look bad in the eyes of the Instagram’s community because you’ll look like you think that your work is so good that everyone is going to try to steal it. Be humble, there are other ways of proving that you own the copyrights to a photo, like keeping the RAW file safely stored on your computer’s hard-drive or including the copyright information in the photo’s metadata.</p><p><strong>Your photos will look like they’ve been edited:</strong> With all the photo effects Instagram offers and all the photo editing options that are available to photographers, straight-out-of-camera pictures will earn you much more respect from the community on Instagram, than photos that are clearly edited. A watermark can often make people think that the picture has been edited since the photographer took the time to design and add a watermark to a photo.</p><p><strong>Adding watermarks will not make you famous:</strong> At first, it may seem like a good idea to use watermarks for the promotion of your business, but most Instagram users don’t really read the names on the watermarks. Strive to produce photos that will make the viewers want to know everything there is to know about you because the quality of your photos is the best advertisement you can get.</p><h2 id="Watermarking-Instagram-Photos-Tips"><a href="#Watermarking-Instagram-Photos-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Watermarking Instagram Photos - Tips"></a>Watermarking Instagram Photos - Tips</h2><p>If, despite all this, you would still like to add a watermark to your Instagram photos, here are a few tips that will help you avoid making mistakes that can be harmful to the success of your images on Instagram.</p><p><strong>Use monochrome watermarks:</strong> Tastefully designed watermarks, that don’t feature too many colors, will serve its purpose, and they will not distract the viewer of a photo too much. A minimalistic approach to watermark design is probably the best, less is more, so use fewer colors in order to achieve better results.</p><p><strong>Place the watermarks around the edges of a photo:</strong> As we already mentioned, adding new visual elements to photos creates all sorts of problems, but if you really want to watermark your photos, at least try to place them on the edges of a photo where they won’t attract too much attention.</p><p><strong>Vertically oriented watermarks create less distraction:</strong> This is a great way to distract the viewer as little as possible while keeping the watermark on your photo clearly visible and readable. If you place a vertically oriented watermark near the edge of a photo, the spectator has a better chance of seeing a photo, before realizing that it has a watermark.</p><p><strong>Carefully choose the font and its size:</strong> Use simple fonts. There is no reason to utilize kitschy fonts that are not easily readable because it isn’t likely that the viewer of a photo is going to spend time on figuring out what the watermark says. Don’t let the watermark become the first thing your Instagram followers see on a photo because they will most probably just keep scrolling without spending a second to figure out what your photo really is about.</p><h2 id="Best-Apps-You-Can-Use-to-Watermark-Your-Photos"><a href="#Best-Apps-You-Can-Use-to-Watermark-Your-Photos" class="headerlink" title="Best Apps You Can Use to Watermark Your Photos"></a>Best Apps You Can Use to Watermark Your Photos</h2><h4 id="1-eZy-Watermark-Lite"><a href="#1-eZy-Watermark-Lite" class="headerlink" title="1. eZy Watermark Lite"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ezy-watermark-lite-photo/id494473910?mt=8" >eZy Watermark Lite <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ezy-watermark-lite-photo.jpg"                                     ></p><p>More than 2 million downloads prove that eZy Watermark Lite is one of the best iPhone apps for adding watermarks at the App Store.

Then tap on the selfie to pin it as a sticker on your picture or video, and then share as your Instagram Story.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135393/19272" target="_top" id="2135393">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135393" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135393/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Use-your-pen"><a href="#Use-your-pen" class="headerlink" title="Use your pen"></a>Use your pen</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-pen.jpg"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1304647">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304647.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1304647">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1304647.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1304647%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1304647/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Now that you have used funny stickers to make your picture (for Insta Story) attractive, how about adding a cute personal note as well? Well, you can do that by tapping on the pen icon right next to ‘Stickers’. Select the desired pen type (highlighter, airbrush, eraser, etc.) from the top and then color from the bottom of the screen. You can adjust the pen size using the slider found at the left side. After writing or doodling on the image, tap on the tick mark at the top right corner and you are good to go.</p><p>Whoa! You are becoming a sport at how to use Instagram Stories.</p><h3 id="Add-text"><a href="#Add-text" class="headerlink" title="Add text"></a>Add text</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-text-to-instagram.jpg"                                     ></p><p>You can also add text to make your Instagram Stories more attractive. Tap on the ‘Aa’ icon on the extreme right corner of your screen (in Instagram camera) and start typing. You can change the font style by tapping the style available on top of the screen, as well as select the color of the ‘Text’. You can also tag people in ‘Text’ by typing ‘@’ and then the handle name of the person, then click on their image.</p><h3 id="Add-color-overlays"><a href="#Add-color-overlays" class="headerlink" title="Add color overlays"></a>Add color overlays</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-pen.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Adorn your creative hat and weave some magic into the Insta Stories now. For adding color overlays to your Insta Story image or video you need to use the ‘Pen’ tool here and choose a color. Now, click anywhere on the screen and hold for a moment until the entire screen is covered with that color. After that tap on the ‘Eraser’ tool and uncover specific portions of the picture or video to create interesting Instagram Stories.</p><h3 id="Add-link"><a href="#Add-link" class="headerlink" title="Add link"></a>Add link</h3><p>Adding links to your Instagram Stories is one of the trendiest things now. Gone are the days of ‘link in bio’ under your description. Though, adding a link to your Instagram Story is now restricted to the verified accounts and business profiles with more than 10,000 followers. This is an interesting way of driving traffic to your business page, or your YouTube channel, and the likes.</p><p>First add a video or picture and then click on the paperclip icon from the top right corner of the screen. Enter your URL after tapping the paperclip icon, and then share it as your Instagram Story to lure your audience. The ‘Swipe Up’ message will be displayed at the bottom of the story. You can drive your audience towards it by being little creative and drawing an arrow pointing to this text.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Post a Link to Instagram Stories and Posts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424527">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424527.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424527">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424527.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424527%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424527/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Add-music"><a href="#Add-music" class="headerlink" title="Add music"></a>Add music</h3><p>If adding ‘Stickers’, ‘Text’, and choosing filters aren’t enough for your perfect Insta Story video, why don’t you try adding your favorite music to it?

When your recording is complete, you can share this video along with your favorite track as your Instagram Story.
