Coming up with new topics for photos that will keep your followers interested and entertained is essential if you want your Instagram profile to attract thousands of likes on a daily basis.</p><p> We’ve gathered some ideas that might inspire you to create photos that will take Instagram by storm, so let’s start discovering different ways of keeping your followers interested while attracting the attention of new Instagrammers.</p><h2 id="Top-20-Inspiring-Instagram-Photos-Ideas"><a href="#Top-20-Inspiring-Instagram-Photos-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="Top 20 Inspiring Instagram Photos Ideas"></a>Top 20 Inspiring Instagram Photos Ideas</h2><p> Keeping an open mind and approaching each idea with a fresh pair of eyes will help you achieve better results, whichever idea from the list below you choose to explore.</p><ul><li><strong>Cityscapes and Landscapes</strong></li></ul><p> There is absolutely no doubt that people love beautiful landscapes, and they often don’t feel shy about showing it. The same goes for gorgeous city scenes captured on rainy nights or early in the morning on your way to work.</p><ul><li><strong>Inspirational Quotes</strong></li></ul><p> Life can be hard, and we all look for inspiration wherever we can find it. Posting inspirational quotes on your Instagram profile can be a great way to inspire others, especially if you post quotes that are directly related to the topic your profile is covering.</p><ul><li><strong>Combine several photos into a single Instagram post</strong></li></ul><p> A picture is worth a thousand words, but not all stories can be told with a single picture. Combining a few photos that tell the stories you want your followers to see, can be a very efficient way of promoting your products or letting your friends know about your latest adventure.</p><ul><li><strong>Selfies</strong></li></ul><p> Selfies have lost a lot of the popularity they had a couple of years ago, but this doesn’t mean that taking a creative selfie on an amazing location isn’t an awesome Instagram photo idea.</p><ul><li><strong>Important events from your life</strong></li></ul><p> Graduating from college, getting the first job, being promoted or moving to another country are all important steps in life, and sharing them with your friends on Instagram will surely help you get a lot of likes.</p><ul><li><strong>Animals doing adorable things</strong></li></ul><p> Pets are like children, we all get attached to them pretty quickly, so why not introduce your furry companions to the Instagram community. Besides, you’ll probably be able to get some amazing shots just by paying attention to the day your pet is having.</p><ul><li><strong>Animate your Instagram profile with Boomerang</strong></li></ul><p> The Instagram’s Boomerang feature is fun to use because it brings a motion to otherwise mostly static profile. The best part is that Boomerang can be used both for professional purposes and entertainment, with an equal amount of success.</p><ul><li><strong>Product Shots</strong></li></ul><p> Online entrepreneurs, as well as big companies, can use Instagram photos as a creative way of familiarizing their potential clients with products and services they are offering. Posting pictures on Instagram should be a part of every online marketing campaign because you never know who is going to stumble upon your photo.</p><ul><li><strong>Hilarious GIFs</strong></li></ul><p> People never forget how you made them feel, so making them laugh is always a good idea. GIFs are incredibly popular and very easy to make, so using your creative energy to cheer up your business associates and friends may help you increase traffic on your Instagram profile. However, you’ll need to have an app that enables you to post GIFs to Instagram, since the platform doesn’t support GIF files.</p><ul><li><strong>Delicious Food</strong></li></ul><p> We all love to eat, which is why pics of delicious food are never a bad idea. However, it goes without saying that taking a photo of every snack you lay your eyes on should probably be avoided . Post only food pics that offer something more than a view of a spaghetti bowl.</p><ul><li><strong>Yoga Poses</strong></li></ul><p> Taking care of your body means that you are taking care of your mind. Yoga is currently one of the most popular recreational activities in the world, and if you know a few good Yoga poses you shouldn’t hesitate to share them.</p><ul><li><strong>Photos of a venue</strong></li></ul><p> This Instagram photo idea works best for cafes, bars or restaurants, although all other types of venues can spark a lot of interest. What’s more, musicians who are playing at several different places in a single week can use these types of shots to promote their gigs.</p><ul><li><strong>Close-up shots</strong></li></ul><p> You can take close-ups of literally anything, however, it is important to take these types of shot in situations that are somehow related to the most important subjects your Instagram account covers. Close-ups are a great choice if you want to appear professional, and add an artistic touch to your Instagram photos.</p><ul><li><strong>Take shots that show your thankfulness</strong></li></ul><p> Show how much you appreciate the support your followers are giving you. You’ll make them feel involved and as a part of the success, your Instagram profile is enjoying.</p><ul><li><strong>A sneak peek of a new project you’re working on</strong></li></ul><p> Nothing sparks interest like a sneak peek shot of a project you are just starting. This Instagram photo idea is a perfect bait for comments and is best used if you want to promote your upcoming project.</p><ul><li><strong>Tell your Instagram followers all about your hobby</strong></li></ul><p> Make things personal, and let your friends know how you like to spend your free time. Hiking, making origami sculptures or reading make great topics for photos, and they give your followers an insight into your life.</p><ul><li><strong>Offer a good tip</strong></li></ul><p> Life hacks can be precious because they offer us a faster and simpler way of doing things. Even if you made a horrible mistake, offering a useful tip will prevent your followers from repeating the same mistake and offer them a way to improve their lives.</p><ul><li><strong>Explore new angles</strong></li></ul><p> Sometimes all we need is a fresh approach to things. The same can be said for Instagram photo ideas because just changing the angle from which you take photos can offer a new perspective on the topic you are covering.</p><ul><li><strong>Show the world what you really stand for</strong></li></ul><p> Sharing corporate values or standing up for the causes you really believe in can get you a lot of sympathy on Instagram. Take photos that reflect the values you stand for, and you’ll see how many people share the same values.</p><ul><li><strong>Share your achievements</strong></li></ul><p> Nothing motivates like success since we all love to watch success stories unfold in front of our eyes. Each of your achievements can inspire others to do great things, so don’t hesitate to use them as an idea for your Instagram photos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-elite-10-hash-trackers-for-major-social-networks-fb-twt-and-ig/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Elite 10 Hash Trackers for Major Social Networks FB, Twt & IG</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-handling-soundtracks-opening-srt-on-pcmac/"><u>[New] Handling Soundtracks Opening SRT on PC/Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-reach-new-heights-on-igtv-top-tactics-for-expanding-your-audience-for-2024/"><u>[New] Reach New Heights on IGTV Top Tactics for Expanding Your Audience for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-maximizing-engagement-with-dual-screen-broadcasting-techniques-in-facebook/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Maximizing Engagement with Dual-Screen Broadcasting Techniques in Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-essential-tips-for-adding-text-to-instagram-videos/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Essential Tips for Adding Text to Instagram Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unveiling-the-secrets-to-verified-instagram-images/"><u>2024 Approved Unveiling the Secrets to Verified Instagram Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/can-life360-track-you-when-your-realme-v30t-is-off-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Can Life360 Track You When Your Realme V30T is off? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/diving-into-advanced-pc-assembly-motherboard-essentials/"><u>Diving Into Advanced PC Assembly: Motherboard Essentials</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/how-to-edit-instagram-photos-like-a-pro/"><u>How to Edit Instagram Photos Like a Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/how-to-subtitle-for-wider-reach-in-insta-tv/"><u>How to Subtitle for Wider Reach in Insta TV</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-infinix-note-30-vip-racing-edition-pin-codepattern-lockpassword-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock Infinix Note 30 VIP Racing Edition PIN Code/Pattern Lock/Password</u></a></li><li><a href="https://common-error.techidaily.com/preventing-ftddi-memory-integrity-failures-by-ensuring-driver-compatibility/"><u>Preventing FTDDI Memory Integrity Failures by Ensuring Driver Compatibility</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/the-commoners-choice-claudio-or-generative-pre-trained/"><u>The Commoner's Choice: Claudio or Generative Pre-Trained?</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1542129">                    <video width="864" height="1152" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1542129.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-1542129">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1542129.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2F25home.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1542129%2F16836'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1542129/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

So, reviewing the pros and cons of the Instagram scheduler is a must prior to using it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/1943750/22993" target="_top" id="1943750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1943750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://homestyler.sjv.io/i/5597632/1943750/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Instagram-Scheduler-for-Android"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Instagram-Scheduler-for-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Instagram Scheduler for Android"></a>Part 2: Best Instagram Scheduler for Android</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129741/7443" target="_top" id="2129741">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129741" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129741/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Buffer"><a href="#1-Buffer" class="headerlink" title="1.

Sometimes we need to accelerate the video to make it more engaging while also saving the viewer’s time. Because Instagram stories and posts have a limited length, we must speed up videos and present them as much as possible in a short amount of time.</p><p>However, most people don’t know <strong>How to Speed Up Video on Instagram</strong>, and if you’re one of them, don’t worry. This article covers an easy method to speed up the video on smartphones and computers and some online tools to assist you. Let’s get started.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">How to Speed up Video for Instagram on iPhone with Hyperlapse?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Speed up Video for Instagram on Android with Filmora?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to Speed up Video for Instagram Online for Free?</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">How to Speed up Video for Instagram on Computer Desktop?</a></p><p>05 <a href="#part5">How to Upload Video from Desktop to Instagram</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Speed-up-Video-for-Instagram-on-iPhone-with-Hyperlapse"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Speed-up-Video-for-Instagram-on-iPhone-with-Hyperlapse" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Speed up Video for Instagram on iPhone with Hyperlapse?"></a>Part 1: How to Speed up Video for Instagram on iPhone with Hyperlapse?</h2><p>When speeding up Instagram videos, Hyperlapse is unquestionably the most acceptable option for iPhone users. A supplementary app (Hyperlapse) for Instagram is specifically developed to allow users to accelerate Instagram video speed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hyperlapse-from-instagram.jpg"                      alt="hyperlapse from instagram"                ></p><p>You have the option of uploading a video from your iPhone or shooting a movie from inside the application. By default, your video is being played at a speed of 6X. This software, however, also has several drawbacks. For example, it can only assist you in increasing the pace of the videos. There are no editing features.</p><p>To know how to speed up a video for Instagram using Hyperlapse, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch Hyperlapse on your iPhone, press the <strong>record</strong> button. Stop filming anytime you wish and keep your hands motionless.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You’ll see a speedometer now. The default speed is <strong>6X</strong>, but you may lower it to <strong>1X</strong> or boost it to <strong>12X</strong> if you choose. Move to the right to speed up the video.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Right after you’ve chosen your desired speed, click “OK.” If you want to share the video, you may do so on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Speed-up-Video-for-Instagram-on-Android-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Speed-up-Video-for-Instagram-on-Android-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Speed up Video for Instagram on Android with Filmora?"></a>Part 2: How to Speed up Video for Instagram on Android with Filmora?</h2><p>On Android, you do not have access to the Hyperlapse application. Hence, you will need Filmora from the Google Play store. It’s one of the most well-regarded video editing tools available.</p><p>This application allows you to convert any video into a slow or fast motion video with no effort. The most attractive feature of this tool is that it allows you to speed up different segments from a single video simultaneously. However, you can only increase the video speed by a factor of two at the most.</p><p>To know how to speed up existing video for Instagram with Filmora, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Touch New Project to begin a new filming session at the bottom of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Choose the video you want to speed up and hit <strong>Import</strong>. After the editor is opened, you may begin editing.

But the platform began to <a class="link"   href="https://later.com/blog/instagram-influencer-vacations/" >care more about engagement <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead of followers, which is why brands are very interested in the likes that you are getting on each post.</p><p> Now people think about buying likes if they feel their engagement levels are not rising quickly enough for them to get more exposure or interesting sponsorship offers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-why-buy-fake-likes.JPG"                      alt="why buy fake likes"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1815678/21290" target="_top" id="1815678">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1815678" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://versadesk.pxf.io/i/5597632/1815678/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-3-Reasons-to-Avoid-Buying-Instagram-Likes"><a href="#Part-2-3-Reasons-to-Avoid-Buying-Instagram-Likes" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: 3 Reasons to Avoid Buying Instagram Likes"></a>Part 2: 3 Reasons to Avoid Buying Instagram Likes</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137203/26400" target="_top" id="2137203">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137203" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137203/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-It-Will-Harm-Your-Engagement"><a href="#1-It-Will-Harm-Your-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="1. It Will Harm Your Engagement"></a>1. It Will Harm Your Engagement</h3><p> When you have more followers on Instagram, it is inevitable that your engagement levels will decline. When an account has less than 1,000 followers, the engagement levels are around eight percent. It goes down to four percent when you have between 1,000 and 10,000 followers. Between 10,000 to 100,000 followers has an engagement level of around 2.4%. And it goes down to 1.7% when you are at a million.</p><p> What do all these numbers mean? It means that if you were to buy likes, you would be arousing suspicion of brands who may want to hire you for sponsorship purposes. Say you are buying a lot of likes because they are cheaper to get than followers. If you have 15,000 followers and an engagement level of 6 or 7 percent, your account is suspicious.</p><h2 id="2-Buying-Fake-Likes-is-a-Black-Hole"><a href="#2-Buying-Fake-Likes-is-a-Black-Hole" class="headerlink" title="2. Buying Fake Likes is a Black Hole"></a>2. Buying Fake Likes is a Black Hole</h2><p> It is so easy to think that you will be purchasing fake likes on Instagram for one or two uses. “I just want to promote a couple of my posts to gain exposure.” These are the words that every like buyer utters. A month later, they are furiously buying likes for every single post they put up on Instagram.</p><p> It is a vicious cycle, because you become addicted to those bought likes. And if you are doing all this to impress brands, you must keep up your engagement levels or they will assume you had a post go viral, which is not necessarily indicative of a popular account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-rules.JPG"                      alt="ins fake likes"                ></p><h3 id="3-Violation-of-Instagram-Rules"><a href="#3-Violation-of-Instagram-Rules" class="headerlink" title="3. Violation of Instagram Rules"></a>3. Violation of Instagram Rules</h3><p> Instagram has very strict guidelines and rules of engagement. Buying likes and followers is against those rules. Of course, they are not going to strike down every single account that buys likes and followers. If they did, it would completely stop as a practice.</p><p> But there is a good chance that you will get caught eventually. And the risk is that your entire account is deleted, including all your followers, likes and posts. You may have a hard time opening up another account with the same identity.</p><p> And many of the sites that offer like buying services get shut down, which instantly impacts the likes you get on your next posts. It can turn into a race of you buying more likes from other sellers, until they get shut down too.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Identify-Accounts-with-Fake-Likes"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Identify-Accounts-with-Fake-Likes" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Identify Accounts with Fake Likes"></a>Part 3: How to Identify Accounts with Fake Likes</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016134/19272" target="_top" id="2016134">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016134" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016134/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Followers-and-Engagement-Levels-Are-Off"><a href="#1-Followers-and-Engagement-Levels-Are-Off" class="headerlink" title="1. Followers and Engagement Levels Are Off"></a>1. Followers and Engagement Levels Are Off</h3><p> There can be anomalies in how many likes an Instagram post gets relative to the account’s followers. For instance, a post may be shared by an influencer and celebrity, causing it to go viral.</p><p> But accounts that have multiple posts with engagement levels of 9 or 10 percent, or even higher, are immediately suspicious. It is not probable for an account to have such a high level of engagement without some like buying.</p><p> Those who are insistent on buying likes will need to buy followers to match up the engagement levels with the numbers we mentioned above. But it is more hassle than it is worth!</p><h3 id="2-Posts-and-Likes-Do-Not-Match-Up"><a href="#2-Posts-and-Likes-Do-Not-Match-Up" class="headerlink" title="2. Posts and Likes Do Not Match Up"></a>2. Posts and Likes Do Not Match Up</h3><p> When an account has very few posts, but any likes on each post, it is unusual. It generally takes a lot of posts before an account can rack up a high follower and like count. The only time accounts with few posts have a lot of likes is when they are started by a celebrity.</p><p> If you notice an influencer has three or four posts in the past month, but they have thousands of likes on each post, it is suspicious. There is a good chance the influencer used inauthentic methods of gaining those likes.</p><h3 id="3-Spam-Comments"><a href="#3-Spam-Comments" class="headerlink" title="3. Spam Comments"></a>3. Spam Comments</h3><p> Ever noticed that some Instagram accounts are dominated by spam comments? You may see two or three genuine-sounding comments in the section. Everything else is some version of “follow me” or a single word phrase. It is indicative of an account where likes, followers and comments are bought.</p><p> Influencers think they can trick people into buying their engagement levels with spam comments. But companies that care about where they spend their marketing budget will do research that goes beyond a cursory glance at the number of followers, likes and comments. They will notice spam comments.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ins-spam-comment.JPG"                      alt="spam comment"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130890/7443" target="_top" id="2130890">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130890" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130890/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Instagram is about so much more than showing off your latest look or meal. It is a platform dominated by influencers, which is why brands are so interested in leveraging it for their own success. Influencers get tempted to buy likes so they can raise their profile and attract better sponsorship offers.</p><p> But purchasing likes on Instagram is a complex process that is fairly easy to spot. Unless you want to go down a black hole of constantly buying likes and followers, it is best to focus your efforts on organically growing your follower count and engagement levels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-transforming-instagram-vids-into-a-backup-solution-via-computers-and-macs/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Transforming Instagram Vids Into a Backup Solution via Computers & Macs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-comprehensive-guide-to-great-ig-videos/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Comprehensive Guide to Great IG Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/approved-improve-engagement-with-skillful-use-of-jump-cuts/"><u>2024 Approved Improve Engagement with Skillful Use of Jump Cuts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/how-to-factory-reset-ipad-or-apple-iphone-xr-without-icloud-password-or-apple-id-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Factory Reset iPad or Apple iPhone XR without iCloud Password or Apple ID?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-full-guide-to-unlock-your-vivo-y100t-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Full Guide to Unlock Your Vivo Y100t</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-remove-the-lock-screen-fingerprint-of-your-xiaomi-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Remove the Lock Screen Fingerprint Of Your Xiaomi</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-sounding-superior-a-guide-to-altering-voice-on-reels-and-stories/"><u>In 2024, Sounding Superior A Guide to Altering Voice on Reels & Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/navigating-the-dynamics-of-instagram-highlight-categories/"><u>Navigating the Dynamics of Instagram Highlight Categories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-reviews.techidaily.com/navigating-through-new-horizons-of-technology-at-toms-system-solutions/"><u>Navigating Through New Horizons of Technology at Tom's System Solutions</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Mobile phones come with unique features that make life easier and more enjoyable.</p><p>Various software and applications have been developed and can be used to find solutions in many ways and in many industries.</p><p>With the advent of social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok, video creation has become increasingly important in many products and organizations.</p><p>Many business owners have found that there is a great deal of value in making engaging video content that can be costly and quality.</p><p>Many industries specialize in creating mind-boggling video content. But what happens when a beginner wishes to create something of the same effect, quality and attractiveness? A variety of applications can help beginners create great content without the need for office space or high-end devices. This little secret is iMovie.</p><p><strong>iMovie Square Video</strong></p><p>One software that works well within the digital space is a video editing application known as iMovie. It is a video editing software supported for macOS, iOS, and iPad OS devices.</p><p>This app was developed in the late 20th century in 1999 and features an easy-to-use interface with a timeline, a preview window, and a media browser.</p><p>Many experts consider iMovie to be a contemporary non-linear editor. With little or no technical experience, videos can be cut or edited without changing the original format of the file using its many features.</p><p>With the high cost of some editing apps, Movie seems to be a good choice for beginners. The Movie is accurate, just like any other Apple product. This software was created with the idea that not everyone is a great editor or expert.</p><p>iMovie is easy to use and with a bit of practice. A newbie can extract quality content and product engagement or personal use.</p><p><strong>Why Square Videos?</strong></p><p>It may surprise us, but square videos have recently received a lot of attention, and the reason for this is not forgotten.</p><p>One important reason for this popularity is that social media platforms such as Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram are the ideal square video games.</p><p>Square videos take up a lot of screen space, especially in viewer feeds, rather than landscape video. The more your screen takes the user’s screen, the better. It may interest you to know that the screen-filling videos are very attractive.</p><p>There are various benefits to using the iMovie app. As mentioned earlier, the app has features for adjusting and enlarging video color settings, cropping and rotating video clips, stabilizing unstable videos, and increasing video transitions (such as blurring and speed changes). Video clip effects include cropping, using a green&#x2F;blue screen to extract a title, replacing the background with a different clip, screen splitting, and making a photo-picture effect.</p><p>By removing background sound and raising audio levels for silent clips, iMovie can also help to convert and enhance video audio.</p><p>Movie trailers can be created using templates provided in iMovie. The trailer tool in iMovie makes it easy to drop clips on a timeline, separated by a panel board with labels indicating what type of clip should be placed in each window.</p><p>A guide to adding titles and credits to the cart is also included in the template. There is no doubt that using iMovie can get a beginner a unique video spark. It can get the industry any updates needed. Developers can use app previews to give users a quick overview of the app using video rather than graphics.</p><p>Let’s look at how to generate square movies for Instagram with iMovie now.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Square-Video-for-Instagram-in-iMovie-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Square-Video-for-Instagram-in-iMovie-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to Make a Square Video for Instagram in iMovie on iPhone?"></a>Part 1. How to Make a Square Video for Instagram in iMovie on iPhone?</h2><p>Videos are a fantastic way to keep memories alive, but some social media platforms - specifically, Instagram - demand videos to be a certain size and length before they can be uploaded. Fortunately, cropping your video before sharing it is a straightforward process. Here are some pointers to help you crop a movie and modify the screen size to whatever you want. Cropping your films is useful for a variety of reasons. Perhaps you’d like to focus on a specific component of the film or get rid of your thumb from the screen’s corner. You’ll need iMovie, which comes preloaded on most iPhones, to crop a video on your iPhone. If your phone does not already have iMovie, you may get it for free from the App Store. The size or aspect ratio of your video will not change if you use this method. It will just zoom in on your video and possibly crop out any unwanted things.</p><p>To use the crop&#x2F;zoom feature in iMovie on iPhone, follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step #1.</strong> On your iPhone, open the iMovie app.</p><p><strong>Step #2.</strong> Navigate to <strong>Projects</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step #3.</strong> The enormous + sign should be tapped. Choose a movie.</p><p><strong>Step #4.</strong> Go to the video you want to crop and select it, then press <strong>Create Movie</strong> at the bottom of the screen.</p><p><strong>Step #5.</strong> Three portions will appear on your screen. In the lower left-hand corner of the screen, tap the timeline section.</p><p><strong>Step #6.</strong> In the upper right-hand corner of the screen, tap the small magnifying glass.</p><p><strong>Step #7.</strong> You may now zoom in and out of your movie with your thumb and forefinger.</p><p><strong>Step #8.</strong> Press the play button to see a preview of the video.</p><p><strong>Step #9.</strong> Tap <strong>Done</strong> in the top left corner when you’re satisfied with the results.</p><p><strong>Step #10.</strong> To save your movie to your Camera Roll, tap the square with an arrow icon.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Square-Video-in-iMovie-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Square-Video-in-iMovie-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Make a Square Video in iMovie on Mac?"></a>Part 2. How to Make a Square Video in iMovie on Mac?</h2><p>iMovie does not allow you to make square videos! You won’t be able to convert your video to square dimensions because there isn’t a way to do it. We’ll edit the video in iMovie and then modify the proportions in Keynote. Only Keynote will be used to crop the video into square dimensions. On Mac OS, Keynote is a presentation program that comes preloaded. First, use iMovie to edit your video as you typically would. Make all of the necessary modifications to the audio and video. Make use of iMovie’s special editing features. After you’ve finished editing the video, export it from iMovie.</p><p>Let’s adjust the dimensions of your video to square using Keynote now that you’ve edited and polished it in iMovie:</p><p><strong>Step #1.</strong> Select the “Basic White” theme from the Basic section of Keynote.</p><p><strong>Step #2.</strong> To select the text boxes, click and drag (or use “cmd + A”) them, then tap “delete”.</p><p><strong>Step #3.</strong> The video should now be dragged and dropped onto the blank slide. Click the <strong>Document</strong> tab in the top right corner of the screen, then pick “Custom Slide Size…” from the <strong>Slide Size</strong> dropdown menu.</p><p><strong>Step #4.</strong> To make a square video, make sure that both the width and height of the movie are the same. For example, if the video’s width is 500 pixels, the height should be 500 pixels as well. Once you’ve finished customizing the width and height of the slide, click “OK” to save it in these dimensions.</p><p><strong>Step #5.</strong> Drag one of your video’s corners out to make it fit the square proportions appropriately.</p><p><strong>Step #6.</strong> Click the <strong>Text</strong> button in the top center of the screen to add text to your square video.

In this section, you will learn how to apply an Instagram filter to any photo from your gallery.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Open Instagram and swipe left</strong></p><p>To add Instagram filters, you have to open Instagram and log in to your existing ID.

Does Instagram have a feature that allows users to know who unfollowed me on Instagram? Is this true? There is a method to do it! To find out, you’ll have to download an app.</p><p>More likes and followers are the two things that every Instagram influencer strives for. However, maintaining your present audience is just as critical. You could be thinking, Who unfollowed me on Instagram? as a result of this experience. As a result, you can know who unfollowed me on Instagram?</p><p>There is no official method to see who has unfollowed you on Instagram. As a result, even if the number of Followers on YOUR profile drops, you will have no idea who unfollowed you.</p><p>There are several third-party Instagram unfollower tracker applications available right now. These are followers and unfollowers trackers for Instagram, so you can observe who no longer finds your posts interesting.</p><h2 id="Third-Party-Instagram-Apps-The-Problem"><a href="#Third-Party-Instagram-Apps-The-Problem" class="headerlink" title="Third-Party Instagram Apps: The Problem"></a>Third-Party Instagram Apps: The Problem</h2><p>While these applications make it simple to see who unfollowed me on Instagram? but they also have a number of drawbacks that should be considered before using them. What can be done by unauthorized developers is heavily limited by Instagram’s API.</p><p>For example, with all these applications, you’ll only view data going back to when you originally installed the program. Every update to your accounts is tracked from the moment you set it up. However, if you lost any followers before downloading the program, you will not recover them.</p><h2 id="FollowMeter-The-Easiest-Best-App-for-Social-Media"><a href="#FollowMeter-The-Easiest-Best-App-for-Social-Media" class="headerlink" title="FollowMeter: The Easiest &amp; Best App for Social Media"></a>FollowMeter: The Easiest &amp; Best App for Social Media</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/followmeter-poster.png"                      alt="followmeter-poster"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098703/14409" target="_top" id="2098703">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098703" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098703/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Our favorite program for finding out who stopped following us was FollowMeter, which we tested out a number of times. Setting it up is simple, the user interface is straightforward, and the Unfollower option is absolutely free of charge. Because it only works after setup, you won’t be able to see who has unfollowed you in the past.</p><p>Users may see who has unfollowed them, who has followed them, who has followed you but has not followed them back, and who has followed you but has not returned the favor. To see who unfollowed me on Instagram?, go to the Unfollowers tab and choose All.</p><h2 id="Apps-for-“Who-unfollowed-me-on-Instagram-”-Research"><a href="#Apps-for-“Who-unfollowed-me-on-Instagram-”-Research" class="headerlink" title="Apps for “Who unfollowed me on Instagram?” Research"></a>Apps for “Who unfollowed me on Instagram?” Research</h2><p>Our research also included various free Instagram unfollowed applications other than Followmeter. Here’s a short rundown of the very successful ones: To be on the safe side, we suggest using FollowMeter since the API and regulations for Instagram are always changing.</p><ul><li>Users and Unfollowers on Android: A Comparison (Free)</li><li>Android Followers+ (Free)</li><li>App for iOS: Followers Tracker Pro (Free)</li><li>Instagram Followers Tracker for iOS (Free)</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972693/19272" target="_top" id="1972693">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972693" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972693/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Stop-Being-Unfollowed-by-People-You-Used-to-Be"><a href="#How-to-Stop-Being-Unfollowed-by-People-You-Used-to-Be" class="headerlink" title="How to Stop Being Unfollowed by People You Used to Be"></a>How to Stop Being Unfollowed by People You Used to Be</h2><p>“Following back” is significant to some social media users because they want to be remembered. As a result, you may wish to follow back those who unfollowed me on Instagram. To stop receiving notifications from an account, unfollow it.</p><p>However, what about individuals who were already doing this before downloading the app? FollowMeter also lets you see who hasn’t followed you back, so you can go ahead and unfollow them.</p><ul><li>Utilize your Instagram account to log in to FollowMeter.</li><li>Tap Unfollowers on the Home page to unfollow people who are following you.</li><li>Go through the accounts you’ve been following and unfollow them one by one by tapping on their names in the list.</li></ul><p>When you make modifications, your Instagram account automatically updates to reflect those changes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982499">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982499.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982499">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982499.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982499%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982499/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Ways-to-Prevent-Losing-Instagram-Followers"><a href="#Ways-to-Prevent-Losing-Instagram-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Ways to Prevent Losing Instagram Followers"></a>Ways to Prevent Losing Instagram Followers</h2><p>Unfollowing you on Instagram might be for various reasons, one of which is because you followed them back.

This kind of manipulation, which typically involves a slew of bots and fake accounts, is frowned upon by Instagram.</p><p>Their follower count may have decreased since Instagram constantly deletes suspicious profiles. These services are indeed a waste of time and money and then have the potential to damage your reputation.</p><p>However, we got an article introducing this service further. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Check out here&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="2-Be-Aware-That-Your-Account-Has-Been-Blacklisted"><a href="#2-Be-Aware-That-Your-Account-Has-Been-Blacklisted" class="headerlink" title="2.Be Aware That Your Account Has Been Blacklisted"></a>2.Be Aware That Your Account Has Been Blacklisted</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/way2-blacklisted.png"                      alt="way2-blacklisted"                ></p><p>A “shadow ban” may be imposed if you attempt to manipulate the Instagram system. If this is the case, Instagram hides or deprioritizes your posts while the app is otherwise functioning normally for you. A shadowban might be the end of all you’ve worked for.</p><p>Those who try to game the system by buying likes or by using third-party cheats will have their accounts shadowbanned. If you’re looking to artificially boost your engagement, you’ll come across apps and services which automatically like or comment on your posts. Don’t eat or drink anything from these people.</p><h3 id="3-You-Post-Too-Frequently-or-Too-Infrequently-on-Your-Blog"><a href="#3-You-Post-Too-Frequently-or-Too-Infrequently-on-Your-Blog" class="headerlink" title="3.You Post Too Frequently or Too Infrequently on Your Blog"></a>3.You Post Too Frequently or Too Infrequently on Your Blog</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/way3-post-frequently-or-infrequently.png"                      alt="way3-post-frequently-or-infrequently"                ></p><p>You’ll lose followers if you bombard them with photographs on a regular basis.

To stop receiving notifications from an account, unfollow it.</p><p>However, what about individuals who were already doing this before downloading the app?

You are likely losing Instagram followers for more causes other than the one listed above.</p><h3 id="1-You’ve-Paid-for-followers-3"><a href="#1-You’ve-Paid-for-followers-3" class="headerlink" title="1.You’ve Paid for followers"></a>1.You’ve Paid for followers</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/buy-followers-price.png"                      alt="buy-followers-price"                ></p><p>Did you pay someone to get you tens of thousands or millions of Instagram followers for several bucks? This kind of manipulation, which typically involves a slew of bots and fake accounts, is frowned upon by Instagram.</p><p>Their follower count may have decreased since Instagram constantly deletes suspicious profiles. These services are indeed a waste of time and money and then have the potential to damage your reputation.</p><p>However, we got an article introducing this service further. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Check out here&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="2-Be-Aware-That-Your-Account-Has-Been-Blacklisted-3"><a href="#2-Be-Aware-That-Your-Account-Has-Been-Blacklisted-3" class="headerlink" title="2.Be Aware That Your Account Has Been Blacklisted"></a>2.Be Aware That Your Account Has Been Blacklisted</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/way2-blacklisted.png"                      alt="way2-blacklisted"                ></p><p>A “shadow ban” may be imposed if you attempt to manipulate the Instagram system. If this is the case, Instagram hides or deprioritizes your posts while the app is otherwise functioning normally for you. A shadowban might be the end of all you’ve worked for.</p><p>Those who try to game the system by buying likes or by using third-party cheats will have their accounts shadowbanned. If you’re looking to artificially boost your engagement, you’ll come across apps and services which automatically like or comment on your posts. Don’t eat or drink anything from these people.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993654">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993654.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993654">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993654.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993654%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993654/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-You-Post-Too-Frequently-or-Too-Infrequently-on-Your-Blog-3"><a href="#3-You-Post-Too-Frequently-or-Too-Infrequently-on-Your-Blog-3" class="headerlink" title="3.You Post Too Frequently or Too Infrequently on Your Blog"></a>3.You Post Too Frequently or Too Infrequently on Your Blog</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/way3-post-frequently-or-infrequently.png"                      alt="way3-post-frequently-or-infrequently"                ></p><p>You’ll lose followers if you bombard them with photographs on a regular basis.

Every month, Instagram users upload millions of photos. Posts and stories on Instagram garner billions of impressions every day. Facebook is its parent company, making it one of the most popular social platforms. It’s a popular photo-sharing platform that allows you to connect with people worldwide and see the latest trends.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-instagram-reels-available-country.jpg"                      alt="google-image-search-poster"                ></p><p>The privacy of Instagram users is very carefully safeguarded. Facebook’s servers store all the images and their digital imprints in highly encrypted form. Therefore, finding the user’s profile using a photo is not a convenient method. Contrary to Facebook, where you can find a user’s profile by using the unique Image ID of images downloaded from their site. Instagram does not provide such a simplified way to identify who uploaded a picture.</p><p>Here are some techniques that can help you locate an Instagram user using Instagram Image Search and Reverse Image Search. However, you can certainly narrow down your search to get more credible results using these methods, despite their inability to identify the exact profile. Various tools and techniques will be discussed in this post for reverse image search Instagram.</p><hr><h2 id="Why-do-You-need-To-Perform-Instagram-Reverse-Image-Search"><a href="#Why-do-You-need-To-Perform-Instagram-Reverse-Image-Search" class="headerlink" title="Why do You need To Perform Instagram Reverse Image Search?"></a><strong>Why do You need To Perform Instagram Reverse Image Search?</strong></h2><p>Two general uses of Instagram image searches are:</p><ul><li>Using an Instagram photo to find a person (a profile);</li><li>When it comes to detecting plagiarism.</li></ul><p>So if you want to find your childhood friend, you can find his profile and reconnect if you have his photo.

They are a great way to categorize and eternalize your stories on the feed for your audience to enjoy repeatedly. <strong>Creating Instagram highlight covers</strong> is a great way to build your brand and make your profile stand out. Moreover, you can customize your highlight covers with patterns, colors, and graphics to add to the overall aesthetic.

Thus, it is vital to have the correct size and dimensions. Creating highlight covers with proper width and height ensures that you do not have to crop any of your designs.</p><p>Generally, the Instagram highlight covers dimensions are the same as Insta stories, that is, 1080 pixels by 1920 pixels or a 9:16 aspect ratio. We recommend using square 1:1 dimensions when designing your custom highlight covers with high pixels as they work well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-instagram-highlight.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Instagram highlight "                ></p><p>When designing custom highlight covers on Canva, you will notice that the icon will be in the middle of a story-size rectangle. The overall aspect ratio to make highlight covers in Canva is 9:16.

Simple designs are perfect for highlight covers as they are easy to see for your audience.</p><p><strong>Tip #3 – Incorporate Your Brand Assets</strong></p><p>Instagram highlight covers are an extension of your brand. Incorporating your brand’s assets is an excellent way to make your highlights feel more professional. You can include your brand voice and style. Or go with the colors, fonts, or design trademarks that you use on other channels.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Creating Instagram Highlight Covers is a quick and easy way to maintain your brand aesthetic and get more views. Putting in some time and effort into creating beautiful, high-quality highlight covers benefits you in many ways.

You may also modify your video so that the slow-motion movement begins and ends when you want it to.</p><p>Here is the informative step-by-step guide for you to learn and record Slo-Mo videos on iPhone and then upload them on Instagram:</p><h3 id="Step-1-Open-the-Camera-App"><a href="#Step-1-Open-the-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Open the Camera App"></a>Step 1: Open the Camera App</h3><p>First and foremost, you need to launch the camera on your iPhone.

The Slow-motion feature allows users to create entertaining videos by transforming ordinary objects into something extraordinary and unique. Instagram lets you make reels with a variety of special effects. We will now show you how to use Instagram Reels to create Slow-motion videos.</p><p>Slow motion video recording has gotten incredibly simple on Instagram reels. Without the need for any other pricey software, the video may be slowed down easily and rapidly online. Now you can adjust the playing speed and experiment with it. Follow these simple steps to make your Reels video:</p><h3 id="Step-1-Launch-Instagram-and-Select-the-Reel-Option"><a href="#Step-1-Launch-Instagram-and-Select-the-Reel-Option" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Launch Instagram and Select the Reel Option"></a>Step 1: Launch Instagram and Select the Reel Option</h3><p>Launch the Instagram app. Once the main page opens, select the <strong>plus icon</strong> showing on the bottom end of the page. Then to enter the <strong>Reels video mode</strong>, select the <strong>Reels option</strong> from the bottom panel beside the story and live options.</p><h3 id="Step-2-Choose-a-Speed-Setting"><a href="#Step-2-Choose-a-Speed-Setting" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Choose a Speed Setting"></a>Step 2: Choose a Speed Setting</h3><p>After selecting the Reels option, tap on the <strong>Speed</strong> option to choose from one of the five <strong>Speed</strong> settings. The setting is set to 1x speed, which is the default speed setting. Now, if you want to record a slow-motion video, set the setting from 0.3x to 0.5x according to your preference.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-reels-video-speed-options.jpg"                      alt="Create Instagram Reels Slow motion video"                ></p><h3 id="Step-3-Start-Recording"><a href="#Step-3-Start-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Start Recording"></a>Step 3: Start Recording</h3><p>Now that you’ve adjusted the speed, click on the <strong>Record</strong> button to begin recording your video. You can also add music by tapping on the <strong>audio</strong> option. If you want to watch the video you’ve recorded, tap on the arrow button and enjoy your video!</p><h2 id="FAQs-about-Instagram-Slow-Motion"><a href="#FAQs-about-Instagram-Slow-Motion" class="headerlink" title="FAQs about Instagram Slow Motion"></a>FAQs about Instagram Slow Motion</h2><ol><li><strong>Can I record only parts of the video in slow motion in Instagram Reel?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, you can. Instagram now also features the ability to record only a portion of a video that you want to slow down. You don’t have to record your Reels video all at once. You can also record it in shorter clips. Then you may combine all the short snippets to make a whole slow-motion video. This allows you to record a video at a quicker rate while recording all other videos at a standard rate. Only a piece of your movie will play at a sluggish speed, while the remainder will go nicely.</p><ol><li><strong>Why can’t I upload a slow motion video on Instagram?</strong></li></ol><p>To upload a slow-mo video on Instagram, you must first alter the video to a slow version and then save the video in a local file on your phones, because usually, you can save all types of videos on phones, but most phones don’t support a rendered version of a slow-mo video. After this, you should be able to upload the video directly to Instagram.</p><ol><li><strong>Besides slow motion, can I record fast-forward videos on Instagram?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, you can. Instagram features a fast-forward option. Select the speed option to change the video’s speed to fast speed. You can set the video at three different fast-forward speed settings: 1x, 2x, and 3x. Now it has become very simple to record a fast-forward video on Instagram.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134243/18498" target="_top" id="2134243">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134243" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134243/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/024-approved-enhance-your-content-strategy-discover-the-power-of-social-blade-and-youtube-data/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Enhance Your Content Strategy - Discover the Power of Social Blade and YouTube Data</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-instagrams-peak-performance-with-these-top-8-planning-tools/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Instagram's Peak Performance with These Top 8 Planning Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/new-chromatic-brilliance-for-video-enthusiasts/"><u>[New] Chromatic Brilliance for Video Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-mastering-instagram-the-ultimate-video-editing-handbook-for-2024/"><u>[New] Mastering Instagram The Ultimate Video Editing Handbook for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-xiaomi-11-series-where-every-snapshot-becomes-a-masterpiece/"><u>[New] Xiaomi 11 Series Where Every Snapshot Becomes a Masterpiece</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-perfectly-record-and-preserve-your-ps3-games/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, How to Perfectly Record and Preserve Your PS3 Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-in-depth-giroptic-360-angle-reviews/"><u>[Updated] In-Depth Giroptic 360-Angle Reviews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-tailor-videos-to-instagrams-preferred-format/"><u>2024 Approved Tailor Videos to Instagram's Preferred Format</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-verified-vids-the-reality-of-instas-self-validation/"><u>2024 Approved Verified Vids The Reality of Insta’s Self-Validation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/6-ways-to-change-spotify-location-on-your-motorola-razr-40-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>6 Ways to Change Spotify Location On Your Motorola Razr 40 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-mega-greninja-for-tecno-spark-10c-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>All You Need To Know About Mega Greninja For Tecno Spark 10C | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-universal-unlock-pattern-for-asus-rog-phone-7-ultimate-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Universal Unlock Pattern for Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/the-aesthetic-almanac-makeup-hair-and-more-on-youtube-for-2024/"><u>The Aesthetic Almanac Makeup, Hair & More on YouTube for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

There’s no need to worry about photo sizes or aspect ratios because Instagram is going to the all the heavy work for you.</p><p>Troubles begin when you want to upload photos and videos that weren’t captured with a Smartphone to Instagram. In most cases, the photos and videos produced by DSLR cameras and other semi-professional and professional equipment are much larger than the sizes supported by Instagram. That is the reason why we created this guide that will help you post visual content that is perfectly adjusted to Instagram in 2021.</p><h2 id="Types-of-Files-Accepted-by-Instagram"><a href="#Types-of-Files-Accepted-by-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Types of Files Accepted by Instagram"></a>Types of Files Accepted by Instagram</h2><p>The first thing you need to pay attention to when uploading images and videos to Instagram is that the files you are uploading are in one of the photo or video formats that Instagram supports.</p><p><strong>Photo File Types</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, Instagram supports only two file formats. You should make sure that your photo is either saved in <strong>JPEG</strong> or <strong>PNG</strong> file format because all other file formats won’t do the trick, and you’ll be forced to go back to the photo editor you used and change the file format before you can upload a photo to Instagram. Posting GIF files is not possible without apps such as GIPHY CAM or GifLab because this type of files isn’t supported by Instagram.</p><p><strong>Video File Types</strong></p><p>Things get much easier when it comes to video since Instagram supports nearly all video file formats you can think of. However, the most commonly used types of video files uploaded to Instagram are have an  codec and a MP.4 file extension, which is the reason why we recommend converting your video files into this file format before uploading them to Instagram.</p><p>Duration of Videos on Instagram</p><p>You can either upload a video to Instagram’s main feed or you can upload it as a story. If you decide to upload a video to the main feed, the time limit is set at just 60 seconds, while the length of a video in an Instagram story cannot exceed 15 seconds.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/999558/11832" target="_top" id="999558">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-999558" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/999558/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Image-Sizes-for-Instagram-Posts"><a href="#Best-Image-Sizes-for-Instagram-Posts" class="headerlink" title="Best Image Sizes for Instagram Posts"></a>Best Image Sizes for Instagram Posts</h2><p>A couple of years ago, Instagram has finally allowed its users to upload images that aren’t square shaped. In 2021, you can also upload horizontally and vertically oriented photos in addition to the standard square shape. However, in order to create a perfect Instagram post, and prevent the platform from cropping your photos you need to use the Instagram image sizes featured below.</p><h4 id="Instagram’s-Main-Feed"><a href="#Instagram’s-Main-Feed" class="headerlink" title="Instagram’s Main Feed"></a>Instagram’s Main Feed</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/instagram-sizes-infographic-1.jpg"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100541/7443" target="_top" id="2100541">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100541" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100541/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The main feed on Instagram is the place where all the posts from people you are following on this platform are displayed. So let’s take a look at the perfect Instagram photo sizes for the main feed.</p><ul><li><strong>Square</strong></li></ul><p>Most digital cameras don’t produce this shape of a photo, which means that you’ll have to change width and height values before you upload a photo to Instagram. The best Instagram photo size for square-shaped images is 1080 px X 1080 px in 1:1 aspect ratio because if you use a picture that has fewer or more pixels than that, the platform may resize your photo automatically.</p><ul><li><strong>Landscape</strong></li></ul><p>This type of picture orientation is frequently used for both videos and photos, however, if you want to upload a horizontally oriented photo to Instagram, we recommend that you use 1,91:1 aspect ratio and 1080 px X 566 px values for the size of a photo.</p><ul><li><strong>Portrait</strong></li></ul><p>Portrait or vertically oriented photos on Instagram should have 8:10 aspect ratio and a 1080 px size value for the shorter side of a photo, and 1350 px value for the longer side of a photo you’d like to post to Instagram.</p><h4 id="Instagram-Stories"><a href="#Instagram-Stories" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Stories"></a>Instagram Stories</h4><p>The photos you post as stories on Instagram are always vertically oriented
